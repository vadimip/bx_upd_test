[P]A good customer development interview gives you insights into problems your customers face using the product and not using it. So, even if the person you are talking to says that they are right and there are no problems, you still need to dig. Every business has pains, and your goal is to uncover them. [/P]
[P]Sure, employees and even management may not even realize the problem persists. But this does not mean they can&amp;#39;t tell you something that will help you find the flaw. So, ask about their business processes, the most pleasant and unpleasant parts of the work, what takes more time. Answers to such questions will help you to identify things that can be improved. [/P][SIZE=18pt][B]3. Stick to the plan[/B][/SIZE]
[P]To get the most out of the interview, you should have a plan. Even better, an interview script with a list of questions. This will help you to compare answers and speed up the analysis afterward.[/P]
[P]Sure, while it is not necessary to ask every person all questions, your list should include topics that can&amp;#39;t be avoided.

[P]Your goal is to get high-quality data, so you need to be careful. Ask one question at a time because if you ask more than one at once, the person will answer the one they prefer. This may lead to gaps and wasted time. [/P]
[P]Another great tactic here is to &amp;quot;parrot the answers,&amp;quot; meaning you should repeat the answer to the prospect to validate it.

Don&amp;#39;t push, adapt and react[/B][/SIZE]
[P]One of the most common mistakes made at customer development interviews is to validate your thoughts by pushing the prospect in the desired direction. This is a bad thing to do, as you are here to listen to feedback and collect insights, not validating something right away. [/P]
[P]This is why you should not define the answer&amp;#39;s direction and push prospects to a specific response. Also, don&amp;#39;t judge and show that you don&amp;#39;t like a reply or disagree. This will demotivate the prospect and lead to low answer quality.[/P][SIZE=18pt][B]6. Avoid &amp;quot;yes/no&amp;quot; and too vague questions[/B][/SIZE]
[P]High-quality questions are crucial to success. So, polish them to ensure there is no probability of answering just &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;no.&amp;quot;  Use Who, what, when, where, why, and how questions, as they are open and will force the prospect to share more info.[/P]

[P]You can increase the effectiveness of an interview by inviting a partner. A two-person team is more effective and less likely to miss important insights.
