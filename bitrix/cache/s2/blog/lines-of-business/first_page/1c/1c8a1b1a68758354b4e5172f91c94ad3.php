So, there are several crucial things to know before starting a business here as a foreigner. Today, we will cover the four most important factors that may affect the success of your business venture in Turkey. <br />
 <br />
[B][U]Trust is сrucial[/U][/B]<br />
<br />
The business culture in Turkey is built around trust. Lots of deals are made and finalized by a handshake, while the paperwork is less important. This does not mean people here do not sign contracts, they do, but before signing they would like to know their new partner better. You should be prepared to attend multiple meetings, including meals, talking about personal things and discussing topics that are not connected to your business. Once people understand you as a person, it will be easier for them to switch to business.<br />
<br />
Recommendations matter as well. If you&#39;ve worked with someone before, and nowadays, the person is in a new company or has a partner you are interested in, a warm invitation will increase your chances to kick off the negotiations.<br />
<br />
[B][U]Religion still largely affects people&#39;s lives[/U][/B]<br />
<br />
Despite being a very modern country, religion &#40;Islam&#41; still largely affects many people&#39;s lives. The most obvious part - there are religious traditions like Ramadan month and the Sacrifice Feast holiday. You need to know what restrictions people put on themselves during such events &#40;like fasting or avoiding doing business&#41; to be more relevant in your communications and avoid embarrassing moments.<br />
<br />
[B][U]Turks want to see respect for their country[/U][/B]<br />
<br />
Turkish people are proud of their country, its history, wins and achievements. So, to establish a good relationship with a Turk, the best way is to talk about the country, ask questions, demonstrate that you have respect and knowledge about its past. Chances are your Turkish counterparts will be happy to talk about such topics, tell you some interesting stories, and such a conversation is perfect for melting the ice and moving forward.<br />
<br />
[B][U]Meetings and meals are important business tools[/U][/B]<br />
<br />
Even the global pandemic could not eliminate the passion Turks have for face-to-face meetings. Sure, today more and more negotiations are handled via Zoom, but there are still enough old-school people who prefer to talk in person. You have to be prepared for that. There are two options for conducting a business meeting: in the office, or in a restaurant. Both have their peculiarities. <br />
<br />
There are several tips on what to expect at a regular business meeting:<br />
<br />
[LIST]<br />
[*]A foreigner should always arrive on time, but Turkish partners may keep you waiting for them. This is absolutely normal, but it is a big no-no to be late yourself, especially with no warning.<br />
[*]Even in the office, nobody will start discussing business issues right away. There should be small talk, which may differ from what people in Western countries are used to. Instead of discussing the weather questions, Turks may start with some family-related questions, sports, or even politics. Don&#39;t be afraid, and be prepared to participate in such a discussion.<br />
[*]If this is the first meeting, there will likely be no decision-makers. Turkish companies usually have a strict hierarchy since many of them are run by families. The goal for the first meeting is usually establishing trust and senior managers will take into play when a certain level of trust has been established.<br />
[/LIST]<br />
Business meals are another great tool that is widely used in Turkish business culture. There are some tips to follow as well:<br />
<br />
[LIST]<br />
[*]Turks are proud of the national cuisine, so you should show your appreciation. Your hosts will expect that you will finish your food and drink a coffee &#40;at least try it with several sips&#41;.<br />
[*]The host always pays the bill. An offer to share a payment may even seem rude. When it is your turn to be a host, you should not expect any bill sharing either.<br />
[*]It is desirable to let the host run the conversation. Insisting on discussing specific topics may seem weird to your counterparts.<br />
[*]Orthodox Muslims will not consume alcohol during the meeting, but some less religious people may drink. So, it is a good idea to wait and see what drinks people are ordering and follow them. If everyone drinks water or tea, stick with these beverages as well.<br />
[/LIST][B][U]You have to be patient to run a business in Turkey[/U][/B]<br />
<br />
Turkey is a Mediterranean and Muslim country, where bargaining is an important part of the culture. People do not like making deals fast, negotiations may take long, and the hierarchy that we&#39;ve mentioned above, also contributes to the decision-making time. Remember, you are a foreigner who has to melt the ice, show appreciation for the country, prove professionalism, and offer good terms. Once all these factors are in place, things will start moving, but not so fast. <br />
<br />
The negotiation culture in Turkey does not imply being too pushy. Instead, you need to show respect in every detail. For example, if you are sending out a presentation, make sure it is full of nice visuals that make it easy for everyone to understand the pitch without actually reading the whole text.";s:12:"~DETAIL_TEXT";s:5475:"Turkey is a very special country that is both modern and very traditional.

[P]Sure, you are here to collect some valuable data to act upon. However, this does not mean you need to rush to your goal. Start the interview with something positive to make contact and win the sympathy of the person you&#39;re interviewing. Thank him or her for, say, filling in the Google forms and accepting an invitation to go through the interview. Also, it is a good idea to say how you will analyze collected information and use it.[/P]<br />
[P]It is essential to give some insights into how this work will benefit the customer and the company and help them optimize business processes and accelerate results. Note that the probability of success here is directly connected to the quality and depth of answers collected throughout the interview.[/P][SIZE=18pt][B]2. Dig to uncover hidden pains[/B][/SIZE]<br />
[P]A good customer development interview gives you insights into problems your customers face using the product and not using it. So, even if the person you are talking to says that they are right and there are no problems, you still need to dig. Every business has pains, and your goal is to uncover them. [/P]<br />
[P]Sure, employees and even management may not even realize the problem persists. But this does not mean they can&#39;t tell you something that will help you find the flaw. So, ask about their business processes, the most pleasant and unpleasant parts of the work, what takes more time. Answers to such questions will help you to identify things that can be improved. [/P][SIZE=18pt][B]3. Stick to the plan[/B][/SIZE]<br />
[P]To get the most out of the interview, you should have a plan. Even better, an interview script with a list of questions. This will help you to compare answers and speed up the analysis afterward.[/P]<br />
[P]Sure, while it is not necessary to ask every person all questions, your list should include topics that can&#39;t be avoided. So, even if you feel that the person you are interviewing does not show a great interest in a particular case, you know it is essential for your goals; ask these questions anyway.[/P][SIZE=18pt][B]4. Move step by step[/B][/SIZE]<br />
[P]Your goal is to get high-quality data, so you need to be careful. Ask one question at a time because if you ask more than one at once, the person will answer the one they prefer. This may lead to gaps and wasted time. [/P]<br />
[P]Another great tactic here is to &quot;parrot the answers,&quot; meaning you should repeat the answer to the prospect to validate it. Like, &quot;So, you say that this business process works like...&quot; This will show your interest and encourage the interviewee simultaneously eliminating any possible misunderstanding.[/P][SIZE=18pt][B]5. Don&#39;t push, adapt and react[/B][/SIZE]<br />
[P]One of the most common mistakes made at customer development interviews is to validate your thoughts by pushing the prospect in the desired direction. This is a bad thing to do, as you are here to listen to feedback and collect insights, not validating something right away. [/P]<br />
[P]This is why you should not define the answer&#39;s direction and push prospects to a specific response. Also, don&#39;t judge and show that you don&#39;t like a reply or disagree. This will demotivate the prospect and lead to low answer quality.[/P][SIZE=18pt][B]6. Avoid &quot;yes/no&quot; and too vague questions[/B][/SIZE]<br />
[P]High-quality questions are crucial to success. So, polish them to ensure there is no probability of answering just &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no.&quot;  Use Who, what, when, where, why, and how questions, as they are open and will force the prospect to share more info.[/P]<br />
[P]Another critical thing is to ensure questions are specific enough to give a high-quality answer. This means you should avoid vague questions like &quot;how it usually goes&quot; and instead focus on discussing some examples of how it was last time &#40;i.e.&#41;[/P][SIZE=18pt][B]7. Be on the same page with your prospect[/B][/SIZE]<br />
[P]To melt the ice, you need to be as close to the prospect as possible. This means no judging, careful listening, and using a specific vocabulary. [/P]<br />
[P]Try to avoid marketing slang like &quot;buying criteria&quot; or other terms that might confuse the person. Ask questions the way everyone will understand. For example, &quot;what is the most important for you while choosing the software?&quot;  [/P][SIZE=18pt][B]8. Form a team[/B][/SIZE]<br />
[P]You can increase the effectiveness of an interview by inviting a partner. A two-person team is more effective and less likely to miss important insights. For example, you can conduct an interview and ask questions while your partner will take notes. Also, the bigger teams often seem more credible and legit, leading to higher answers. [/P]<br />
[P]However, try not to enlarge your team too much. Two team members for one prospect is enough.

Also, it is a good idea to say how you will analyze collected information and use it.[/P]
[P]It is essential to give some insights into how this work will benefit the customer and the company and help them optimize business processes and accelerate results. Note that the probability of success here is directly connected to the quality and depth of answers collected throughout the interview.[/P][SIZE=18pt][B]2. Dig to uncover hidden pains[/B][/SIZE]
[P]A good customer development interview gives you insights into problems your customers face using the product and not using it. So, even if the person you are talking to says that they are right and there are no problems, you still need to dig. Every business has pains, and your goal is to uncover them. [/P]
[P]Sure, employees and even management may not even realize the problem persists. But this does not mean they can&#39;t tell you something that will help you find the flaw. So, ask about their business processes, the most pleasant and unpleasant parts of the work, what takes more time. Answers to such questions will help you to identify things that can be improved. [/P][SIZE=18pt][B]3. Stick to the plan[/B][/SIZE]
[P]To get the most out of the interview, you should have a plan. Even better, an interview script with a list of questions. This will help you to compare answers and speed up the analysis afterward.[/P]
[P]Sure, while it is not necessary to ask every person all questions, your list should include topics that can&#39;t be avoided. So, even if you feel that the person you are interviewing does not show a great interest in a particular case, you know it is essential for your goals; ask these questions anyway.[/P][SIZE=18pt][B]4. Move step by step[/B][/SIZE]
[P]Your goal is to get high-quality data, so you need to be careful. Ask one question at a time because if you ask more than one at once, the person will answer the one they prefer. This may lead to gaps and wasted time. [/P]
[P]Another great tactic here is to &quot;parrot the answers,&quot; meaning you should repeat the answer to the prospect to validate it. Like, &quot;So, you say that this business process works like...&quot; This will show your interest and encourage the interviewee simultaneously eliminating any possible misunderstanding.[/P][SIZE=18pt][B]5. Don&#39;t push, adapt and react[/B][/SIZE]
[P]One of the most common mistakes made at customer development interviews is to validate your thoughts by pushing the prospect in the desired direction. This is a bad thing to do, as you are here to listen to feedback and collect insights, not validating something right away. [/P]
[P]This is why you should not define the answer&#39;s direction and push prospects to a specific response. Also, don&#39;t judge and show that you don&#39;t like a reply or disagree. This will demotivate the prospect and lead to low answer quality.[/P][SIZE=18pt][B]6. Avoid &quot;yes/no&quot; and too vague questions[/B][/SIZE]
[P]High-quality questions are crucial to success. So, polish them to ensure there is no probability of answering just &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no.&quot;  Use Who, what, when, where, why, and how questions, as they are open and will force the prospect to share more info.[/P]
[P]Another critical thing is to ensure questions are specific enough to give a high-quality answer. This means you should avoid vague questions like &quot;how it usually goes&quot; and instead focus on discussing some examples of how it was last time (i.e.)[/P][SIZE=18pt][B]7. Be on the same page with your prospect[/B][/SIZE]
[P]To melt the ice, you need to be as close to the prospect as possible. This means no judging, careful listening, and using a specific vocabulary. [/P]
[P]Try to avoid marketing slang like &quot;buying criteria&quot; or other terms that might confuse the person. Ask questions the way everyone will understand. For example, &quot;what is the most important for you while choosing the software?&quot;  [/P][SIZE=18pt][B]8. Form a team[/B][/SIZE]
[P]You can increase the effectiveness of an interview by inviting a partner. A two-person team is more effective and less likely to miss important insights. For example, you can conduct an interview and ask questions while your partner will take notes. Also, the bigger teams often seem more credible and legit, leading to higher answers. [/P]
[P]However, try not to enlarge your team too much. Two team members for one prospect is enough. More people will impose additional pressure and intimidate participants.[/P]";s:16:"DETAIL_TEXT_TYPE";s:4:"text";s:17:"~DETAIL_TEXT_TYPE";s:4:"text";s:11:"DATE_CREATE";s:17:"16.03.2021, 18:50";s:12:"~DATE_CREATE";s:17:"16.03.2021, 18:50";s:15:"DATE_PUBLISH_X1";s:19:"2021-03-16 18:47:00";s:16:"~DATE_PUBLISH_X1";s:19:"2021-03-16 18:47:00";s:12:"DATE_PUBLISH";s:17:"16.03.2021, 18:47";s:13:"~DATE_PUBLISH";s:17:"16.03.2021, 18:47";s:8:"KEYWORDS";N;s:9:"~KEYWORDS";N;s:14:"PUBLISH_STATUS";s:1:"P";s:15:"~PUBLISH_STATUS";s:1:"P";s:8:"ATRIBUTE";N;s:9:"~ATRIBUTE";N;s:10:"ATTACH_IMG";N;s:11:"~ATTACH_IMG";N;s:16:"ENABLE_TRACKBACK";s:1:"N";s:17:"~ENABLE_TRACKBACK";s:1:"N";s:15:"ENABLE_COMMENTS";s:1:"Y";s:16:"~ENABLE_COMMENTS";s:1:"Y";s:5:"VIEWS";s:3:"143";s:6:"~VIEWS";s:3:"143";s:12:"NUM_COMMENTS";s:1:"0";s:13:"~NUM_COMMENTS";s:1:"0";s:16:"NUM_COMMENTS_ALL";s:1:"0";s:17:"~NUM_COMMENTS_ALL";s:1:"0";s:4:"CODE";s:58:"how-to-improve-your-customer-development-interviews-in-b2b";s:5:"~CODE";s:58:"how-to-improve-your-customer-development-interviews-in-b2b";s:5:"MICRO";s:1:"N";s:6:"~MICRO";s:1:"N";s:14:"DATE_PUBLISHED";s:1:"Y";s:9:"urlToBlog";s:22:"/digital-intelligence/";s:9:"urlToPost";s:78:"/lines-of-business/how-to-improve-your-customer-development-interviews-in-b2b/";s:11:"urlToAuthor";s:11:"/user/1148/";s:8:"arImages";a:1:{i:57;a:2:{s:5:"small";s:82:"/bitrix/components/bitrix/blog/show_file.php?fid=57&width=70&height=70&type=square";s:4:"full";s:74:"/bitrix/components/bitrix/blog/show_file.php?fid=57&width=1000&height=1000";}}s:13:"TEXT_FORMATED";s:192:"[P]Customer development is crucial for improving the product and tailoring it to the real customer&#39;s needs.

Such complex and costly projects require thorough planning, having answers for dozens of questions that may arise in the process.[/P]<br />
[P]This seems obvious, however many ERP implementation projects fail or show performance that is lower than expected, due to wrong expectations. Customers expect to get better results and much faster than it can be done. As a result: the ERP implementation project can quickly go out of control, take longer, and produce less outcome than everyone thought it would do.[/P]<br />
[P]So, the right approach to ERP planning and setting realistic goals is crucial for overall success. This article will talk about filling the gaps between what the customer is expecting to get from the ERP, what real outcomes will be, and how to match them.[/P]<br />
[P][B][U]The problem[/U][/B][/P]<br />
[P]First, it is crucial to understand the problem entirely. It can be formulated as follows: in reality, ERP systems implementation projects are far less predictable and consistent than many customers think. Many people view the software implementation project as production or home restoration, where you have the budget, resources, the timeline with specific milestones, and that&#39;s it.[/P]<br />
[P]However, software-related projects require much more preparation work, and setting the right expectations is one of the main elements of this work. There are many reasons why the project may take longer, a broader feature-set will not be the best option, and no specific date when you are done with it. ERP implementation and managing business processes are ongoing processes. [/P]<br />
[P]Once the customer understands that, the whole job becomes easier for the vendor and its partners. So, it is essential to properly work with expectations, form them, and thoroughly describe what the customer will get at every implementation project step. Here are some things to consider:[/P]<br />
[P][B]Everything starts at pre-sale[/B][/P]<br />
[P]The success of an implementation project starts at a pre-sale stage. If the vendor or its partners promise too much, the risks of not meeting the expectation arise significantly. [/P]<br />
[P]There were studies conducted to determine the success rate of ERP implementation projects. These studies have shown that despite right after the project is finished, most customers are happy about it, a short time after that, the number of positive reviews decreases dramatically. This is because people do not get what they expected they would receive.[/P]<br />
[P]Again, if the bar of expectations is inappropriately high; there are no chances to meet these expectations. Happily, there are several steps you can take to avoid this problem.[/P]<br />
[P][B]1. Define your goals[/B][/P]<br />
[P]Surprisingly, but quite often, companies and their management teams do not have clear expectations of what they should get. This is a hazardous situation because it provokes changes in mind during the implementation process, which usually leads to additional costs and failed deadlines.[/P]<br />
[P]Another problem is having one big goal, i.e., &quot;become a more efficient business.&quot; This is too vague. The customer most likely will need help in figuring this out. Still, the vendor and its partners should help the company first set up a goal, and second, divide it into several milestones that are easier to plan, calculate, and measure. Once every smaller goal is reached, the result becomes something real. Every step made helps people involved in the project to understand what the next step will bring.[/P]<br />
[P][B]2. Lower expectations when possible[/B][/P]<br />
[P]While there are ways to affect expectations by setting smart goals indirectly, you can also directly work with this aspect. A good tactic here is to intentionally lower them, describing just the core functionality of the product. This tactic is surprisingly efficient.[/P]<br />
[P]For example, there was a situation when the 1Ci partner in Bulgaria, DAVID Holdings Inc., was working on the ERP implementation in Bulgarian airports. The customer wanted to start using the system fast, with limited functionality and viewed it as a temporary solution with the plan to later switch to another product. That was 12 years ago, and the customer is still using 1C:ERP as it turned out that the solution has all the necessary functions, and is compliant to local legislation. So, switching to another solution would become a waste of time and resources.[/P]<br />
[P][B]3. Benchmark[/B][/P]<br />
[P]There are a lot of business automation software vendors that claim their products can be implemented very fast. However, in reality, the fully-functional implementation takes months. So, if the customer has seen such overly optimistic estimates somewhere, it is an excellent idea to benchmark the speed with the functionality provided in such a short time. Once the connection between the time and the business tasks that can be solved is established, it will be easier to justify the deadlines.[/P]<br />
[P][B]4. Prepare a plan and describe deliverables[/B][/P]<br />
[P]Once you&#39;ve got the project goals, and the minimal viable expectations, it is the time to prepare a comprehensive plan. The main idea is that the customer should understand what will happen at every stage of the project, what job will be done, how long it will take, and how many resources will require. [/P]<br />
[P]These steps should be negotiated with all the stakeholders so that the plan includes all the crucial things for these people, their departments, and employees. This means the exact deliverables should be described for each step of the implementation project.[/P]<br />
[P]What features each of the department will get? How will the employee training look like? When will they be able to start using the software? These facts, along with some data on future scaling, will help you form correct expectations.[/P]<br />
[P][B]5. Form a dedicated team[/B][/P]<br />
[P]No complex project like ERP implementation can be done if there is not a right team. You need to include the key stakeholders, people who will use the product once it is in production, representatives from the vendor side, or partners that will do the job themselves. It is crucial that the team roster is not changing in the project&#39;s course, as new people will bring new ideas that can not align with the initial vision. This will lead to wasted time and money. [/P]<br />
[P]The people in the team should also be responsible for the project; its implementation in different departments and business units. This is the only way to set up a path to success.[/P]<br />

the business seeking opportunities to boost their growth, ERP software can be a great way to solve the task. However, there are too many ERP solutions nowadays,[CUT] which makes it hard to choose the right tool to use. So, companies have to conduct analysis, send RFPs &#40;requests for proposals&#41; to vendors and their partners, etc.[/P]<br />
[P]An excellent ERP implementation proposal can be a critical success element for the whole project. Since 60&#37; of ERP projects are categorized as a failure, the better the job at the first stage is done, the better the outcome will be. Today we will talk about preparing an effective business proposal for an ERP system implementation.[/P]<br />
[P][B][U]How to sell ERP software: preparation[/U][/B][/P]<br />
[P]ERP solution is a complicated and often costly business tool that can either deliver great results or devour resources and set the business behind its competitors. The main difference between a successful and failed implementation project usually is in the amount and the quality of data collected at the preparation stage.[/P]<br />
[P]ERP vendors partners selling the solution should determine priorities, understand the business&#39; challenges, and act upon this information when proposing solutions and design choices. Basically, here is the list of things you&#39;ll need to go through:[/P][LIST]<br />
[*][P]Project scope. Here you&#39;ll need to understand any restrictions &#40;either organizational or geographical&#41;, the need to migrate the data, what features for what business processes the solution should have, describe the solution&#39;s architecture, and the infrastructure needed to support it.[/P]<br />
[/LIST][LIST]<br />
[*][P]Implementation methodology. Choosing the approach that is optimal for the client, from traditional to fast implementation.[/P]<br />
[/LIST][LIST]<br />
[*][P]Business application deployment strategy. Common options include a one-time or phased solution rollout and commissioning.[/P]<br />
[/LIST][LIST]<br />
[*][P]Resource allocation for the project. You will need to research and describe all issues related to building the project team and the project office.[/P]<br />
[/LIST][LIST]<br />
[*][P]Scope of work of the project implementation support partner. One of the critical elements of the implementation process is the correct responsibility distribution. Decide what parts you as a partner and the customer will be responsible for, who precisely from the teams will own these specific parts of work.[/P]<br />
[/LIST][P]Here are six steps you will need to go through to identify key pain points and collect all the data for selling ERP software.[/P]<br />
[P][B]Step #0: Business assessment[/B][/P]<br />
[P]It is crucial to understand what industry the business is working in, what geography is, are there any unique business processes or peculiarities in the legislation that should be supported.[/P]<br />
[P]Also, at this stage, it is good to know what the exact reason was for the customer to replace an existing ERP solution or to go shopping for the first time. The reason may be compound and include the quality of the software or the support, its ability to fit unique business processes, or the management can have an idea that the company&#39;s decision-making process can be boosted by improving the quality of data.[/P]<br />
[P]Another important task at this stage of the implementation process is understanding the business priorities and pain points. You need to know whether the source of the problems is business processes or software. Also, you have to figure out whether the ERP implementation is within the vital company&#39;s tasks at the moment. This will primarily affect the following steps.[/P]<br />
[P][B]Step #1: Project objectives[/B][/P]<br />
[P]Before you will do anything, it is necessary to set up the project objectives. This should be done in cooperation with the key functional managers. These are the people who will work with the solution every day, so they are the perfect information sources. They will help determine the exact project objectives that can be then used as guidelines for determining priorities in implementing project tasks, problem-solving, and making other important decisions.[/P]<br />
[P]Objectives can be divided into two levels: high-level or practical low-level goals. The high-level goals may include:[/P][LIST]<br />
[*][P]Improving the quality of customer service[/P]<br />
[*][P]Improving productivity[/P]<br />
[*][P]Reducing process duration or order execution time[/P]<br />
[*][P]Optimizing costs and expenses[/P]<br />
[*][P]Improving the existing business strategies or creating opportunities for new business strategies[/P]<br />
[/LIST][P]The practical objectives are formulated in better details and should be:[/P][LIST]<br />
[*][P]Specific and quantitative[/P]<br />
[*][P]Measurable[/P]<br />
[*][P]Approved by the company management[/P]<br />
[*][P]Have an owner who is responsible for their fulfillment[/P]<br />
[/LIST]<br />
[P]Note: The project objectives are the company&#39;s targets to achieve as a result of ERP implementation. They are not reached immediately after ERP commissioning. This is crucial to negotiate this with the company&#39;s management to set up the right expectations.[/P]<br />
[P][B]Step #2: Project scope[/B][/P]<br />
[P]After the objectives are identified, it is time to narrow things down to outline the project&#39;s overall scope. Here are what areas you need to cover to determine the scope correctly:[/P][LIST]<br />
[*][P]Company structure[/P]<br />
[*][P]Business processes[/P]<br />
[*][P]Business applications &#40;modules&#41;[/P]<br />
[*][P]The functionality of business applications[/P]<br />
[*][P]Data migration[/P]<br />
[*][P]Interfaces and technical architecture[/P]<br />
[*][P]Reports[/P]<br />
[*][P]Enhancements of standard program code[/P]<br />
[*][P]Scale of operations[/P]<br />
[*][P]Exceptions to the project framework[/P]<br />
[/LIST][P]You have to fully understand the corporate structure, including any possible foreign legal entities, the full list of business processes to automate provided by key stakeholders, understand the list of applications and modules to use. Pay specific attention to data migration questions, including the composition of data to be migrated, data sources, and client resources availability for data preparation and normalization. Finally, it is crucial to understand the technical landscape for current and future corporate infrastructure.[/P]<br />
[P][B]Step #3: Implementation methodology[/B][/P]<br />
[P]There are several ERP implementation methodologies, and each of them contains standard sets of tasks, including requirements collection and analysis, design, solution development, testing, and preparation for the operation. The differences between such methodologies are to what extent, how, and when these tasks are performed. [/P]<br />
[P] We can distinguish two extreme cases to illustrate this:[/P][LIST]<br />
[*][P]Traditional approach[/P]<br />
[*][P]Quick implementation[/P]<br />
[/LIST][P]In reality, chances are that you will be using something in the middle of this range. It is crucial to outline and present the customer with the advantages and restrictions of each option. For example, if the customer has specific ERP requirements and also wants to speed up the implementation, it may be necessary to adjust these requirements and divide the project into stages.[/P]<br />
[P][B]Step #4: ERP deployment strategy[/B][/P]<br />
[P]Another critical step is to develop an ERP deployment strategy. You need to gather the information that will allow you to offer a customer the strategy that suits the specific company and its situation.[/P]<br />
[P]Basically, you will need to decide between two primary options:[/P][LIST]<br />
[*][P]One-time rollout[/P]<br />
[*][P]Phased rollout[/P]<br />
[/LIST][P]The former is good for not that big projects, local implementation, and medium complexity processes. The risks may arise if this rollout method is used, combined with the step above&#39;s quick implementation approach. The attempt to rapidly roll out the ERP system for the company with complex and unique business processes may also lead to problems. In such cases, a phased rollout is better.[/P]<br />
[P]Phased implementation allows us to mitigate risks. Also, when you move in smaller iterations, it is easier to achieve visible results. Moreover, dividing the rollout into phases decreases the customer&#39;s resources and lowers the project cost.[/P]<br />
[P][B]Step #5: [/B][B]Key roles and responsibilities[/B][/P]<br />
[P]You can&#39;t start working on the ERP system implementation project before you&#39;ve completed this step. It is crucial to have a detailed description of the responsibility zones, roles of every person in the implementation team both from the customer and the vendor or its partner side.[/P]<br />
