[P]Nowadays, many software products help people become more efficient everywhere, from personal life to business. And speaking about the latter, ERP software is undoubtedly one of the most significant improvements in the last decades. Today we will talk about these tools, how you can use them, and what you should know about this technology.[/P]<br />
[P][B][U]What is ERP software[/U][/B][/P]<br />
[P]ERP stands for “Enterprise Resource Planning,” i.e., the management consolidation and organization of the business data using a single solution. Usually, ERP software consists of several modules each used for the automation of the specific business processes like production, sales quoting, accounting, and more.[/P]<br />
[P]Simply put, the ERP is used to analyze, optimize, and boost operations in every department. Here is a list of crucial modules every good ERP software should include:[/P][LIST]<br />
[*][P]Customer relationship management &#40;CRM&#41;. The CRM module helps businesses to manage their customers, leads, and optimize sales processes. Basic CRM features of the ERP system usually include contact lists, comments, and a history of interactions with the specific customer. This allows companies to understand their customer base, run promotions, and adjust marketing based on the purchase history data.[/P]<br />
[*][P]Human Resources. This module deals with the whole employee list of the company. The Human Resources module of an ERP solution collects data on every employee, including payroll, vacations, etc. Automating such accounting and H.R. tasks usually lead to higher data accuracy and fewer mistakes due to manual data collection and management.[/P]<br />
[*][P]Financial management. Financial management-related modules are the core functionality of any ERP solution. For example, these modules can provide features for real-time revenue and ROI calculation and assessment based on sales data.[/P]<br />
[*][P]Sales. First, an ERP business solution should provide flexible features for working with corporate finances, including sales and invoicing. For example, 1C:ERP allows using multiple payment methods, including Cash, Electronic, and others &#40;e.g., checks&#41;. Users can even use terms templates to quickly set payment terms for partners and customers with no need to define each payment term manually. [/P]<br />
[/LIST][P][/P][LIST]<br />
[*][P]Inventory and supply chain management. For businesses that sell goods and manage their warehouses, inventory, and supply chain management are crucial. Planning demand peaks is essential to avoid situations when the company runs out of goods during high-demand spikes or has an over-filled warehouse when sales are low. Both cases lead to direct and indirect losses.[/P]<br />
[*][P]Procurement. Another important module of an ERP system is procurement. This module combines the functionality related to everything the company needs to buy and purchase to support its business processes and production.[/P]<br />
[*][P]Production planning and control. ERP software allows uploading the data on business and production processes, which then will automatically apply. This helps the company to ensure the sustainability and high quality of the production process.[/P]<br />
[*][P]Tax management and reporting. Tax management and reporting is a crucial part of any business. ERP systems are used to provide compliance with local regulations, automatically apply VAT withholdings, and more.[/P]<br />
[/LIST]<br />
<br />
[P][B][U]Types of ERP[/U][/B][/P]<br />
[P]There are also several types of ERP software:[/P][LIST]<br />
[*][P]On-premise ERP. Such solutions are deployed directly on the business&#39; in-site devices. Companies of all kinds can use such implementations, but usually, on-premise ERP is something you can meet in medium and large enterprises.[/P]<br />
[*][P]Cloud-based ERP. Alternatively to the on-premise implementation, cloud-based ERPs are accessible via the internet.[/P]<br />
[*][P]Hybrid ERP. Some solutions combine cloud and on-premise functionality.[/P]<br />
[*][P]Open Source ERP. As always happens with open-source, these are systems that can be developed and changed to tailor the software to the company&#39;s needs better. Most often, such tools are used by companies with experienced software development teams.[/P]<br />
[/LIST]<br />
[P][B][U]Benefits of using ERP[/U][/B][/P]<br />
[P]The implementation of an ERP system allows the company to automate its vital business processes, and start to collect all business-related data in one place instead of having a dispersed toolbox of different apps and Excel files to use.[/P]<br />
[P]With ERP software, all the business processes become more transparent and predictable, which is good for more effective planning. This allows the management team to stay on top of the business&#39; KPIs, understand what is going on in the company, what key metrics are, and how they evolve and make more informed decisions. Thus, it is easier to achieve a better growth pace.[/P]<br />
[P][B][U]How to choose an ERP[/U][/B][/P]<br />
[P]After we&#39;ve talked about the types of ERP, key modules, and benefits, it is an excellent time to go through the things to analyze when choosing such a solution. [/P]<br />
[P][B]Functionality[/B][/P]<br />
[P]Before choosing the ERP system, it is crucial to analyze its functionality. Often such systems are tailored to specific types of business &#40;services, wholesale &amp; distribution, apparel, production, etc.&#41; If you have a production company, you will need your ERP to provide production planning, cost-calculation, technological process control functions, and variance control for working with sophisticated goods.[/P]<br />
[P][B]Scalability[/B][/P]<br />
[P]A common mistake when choosing an ERP is overlooking its scalability. Some software products are excellent and affordable for small teams but become inefficient and costly once the business has grown up. To better understand the real scalability of the specific ERP, you will need to study its documentation carefully, talk to other users, and ask the developers to explain the pricing model that will apply once you need more features.[/P]<br />
[P]The best plan is to find the solution with all the necessary features out of the box with no additional costs for adding new features.[/P]<br />
[P][B]Flexibility[/B][/P]<br />
[P]Not all ERPs are flexible enough to support the current business infrastructure and its unique business processes. Choosing such a system may lead to a situation when the company adjusts its business processes to fit into the ERP model. When the company has to adjust its processes to fit the ERP better, it can lose its unique competitive advantages. This will prevent the business from standing out from the crowd. The ERP should adapt to your business, not vice versa. This is the only way to get the most out of technology. [/P]<br />
[P]So, the more flexible the software is, the better the result will be. The better ways of using the system, the more extensive the list of the supported operating systems and database formats is. The system should also be able to integrate with other business applications to aggregate all the data in one place.[/P]<br />
[P][B]Customization opportunities[/B][/P]<br />
[P]Also, chances are you will one day need to implement something that is not developed in the standard realization of the ERP. This should not be a problem as the good ERP systems nowadays provide customization opportunities like:[/P][LIST]<br />
[*][P]adding CAD/PDM connectors, [/P]<br />
[*][P]setting up custom dashboards and reports, [/P]<br />
[*][P]conducting multi-currency accounting,[/P]<br />
[*][P]supporting several processes within one solution &#40;e.g., sales and services&#41;,[/P]<br />
[*][P]managing stocks in real-time.[/P]<br />
[/LIST]<br />
[P][B]Security[/B][/P]<br />
[P]Your business data is the company&#39;s asset, which should be secured. This is why you should choose an ERP that provides a high level of security. There should be an opportunity to set flexible access permissions, implement additional security measures like two-factor authentication, etc. If there is an option of using the ERP as a standalone implementation deployed in a corporate intranet or a private cloud, it is a plus as well.[/P]<br />

[P]In this article, we will go through the most significant advantages of using ERP and cover essential steps of the implementation process and factors to consider to get the solution that suits you best.[/P][B][U]Why do you need ERP? [/U][/B]<br />
[P]The very nature of the ERP technology suggests that such software allows boosting critical business processes by eliminating manual labor and providing data for better decision-making and automation. [/P]<br />
[P]With an ERP, the company can collect all data on sales, production, warehouse, or resource planning in one place instead of multiple software solutions and Excel spreadsheets.[/P]<br />
[P]This automatically increases the quality of data for building reports. Thus, the management gets a 360-degree view of a company and its every business process. Instead of guessing and using intuition, managers can see all bottlenecks and points for critical metrics and KPIs&#39; potential growth.[/P]<br />
[P]As a result, the business gets more money, reduces costs, and achieves higher ROI. Also, the higher the service&#39;s quality, the more loyal customers and partners are, which reduces churn.[/P]<br />
[P]The whole list of ERP technology advantages includes:[/P][LIST]<br />
[*][P]Effective production planning[/P]<br />
[*][P]Real-time data collection[/P]<br />
[*][P]360-Degree View of the company[/P]<br />
[*][P]Highly efficient reporting[/P]<br />
[*][P]Enhanced collaboration within the company[/P]<br />
[*][P]Better productivity = higher ROI[/P]<br />
[*][P]Savings on operational costs[/P]<br />
[*][P]Improved customer service and marketing[/P]<br />
[/LIST]<br />
[U]Choosing an ERP: how to set up a requirements list[/U]<br />
[P]ERP technology has proven itself as an efficient solution for many industries, including:[/P][LIST]<br />
[*][P]Manufacturing[/P]<br />
[*][P]Wholesale &amp; Distribution[/P]<br />
[*][P]Industrial Services[/P]<br />
[*][P]Service Companies[/P]<br />
[*][P]Professional Services[/P]<br />
[*][P]Construction[/P]<br />
[*][P]Healthcare[/P]<br />
[/LIST]<br />
[P]However, all these industries are different, and every business within the given vertical is unique. Developers tailor their ERP systems to either a specific industry or even a niche within the industry. For the end customers, this means that they have to put some work into market research and analysis to get the solution useful for them.[/P]<br />
[P]To get the best solution, you will have to outline your requirements and then map them to the available tools to filter those that are not a good fit.[/P]<br />
[P]Setting up a requirements list can be tricky. One of the most effective ways is to build it upon your current business processes to automate and make it more efficient. Simply put, if a specific ERP does not support your needed business process, the implementation will be a complete waste of time and money.[/P]<br />
[P]Here is how such a requirements list may look like:[/P][LIST]<br />
[*][P]Sales management and Order tracking[/P]<br />
[*][P]Service quality control[/P]<br />
[*][P]Field pre-repair diagnostics, field employees management, and workload control[/P]<br />
[*][P]Warehouse management and procurement planning[/P]<br />
[*][P]Project costing and ROI calculation[/P]<br />
[*][P]Support for complex business processes [/P]<br />
[*][P]Invoicing and cash flow management[/P]<br />
[*][P]Customer relations management[/P]<br />
[/LIST]<br />
[P]So, you&#39;ve mapped your list and shortlisted some ERP solutions. What&#39;s next? Let&#39;s talk about things to look for to find the best tool. [/P][U]Step #1: choose among different types of installation[/U]<br />
[P]There are different ways of ERP implementations, and all of them have their pros and cons. There are two major types of ERP solutions you can choose from on-premise software and cloud systems.[/P]<br />
[P]On-premise or on-prem software runs locally in the corporate infrastructure. This gives the company full control over its data, and information flows, etc. However, this option also has a  management overhead as you will need to support your ERP, update it, spend time and resources. That said, you will also get a higher level of flexibility and will be able to develop your system to tailor it to changing business processes and requirements.[/P]<br />
[P]Alternatively, cloud ERP works in the cloud, i.e., on a remote server managed by the ERP developers. These companies have a large-scale infrastructure that can cost hundreds and thousands of customers at the same time. This option reduces an overhead as support, fixes, and development are delegated to the vendor. However, in this case, the business will also have limited customization capabilities and flexibility.[/P]<br />
[P]There is also a hybrid model of private cloud, when the company has access to the cloud and full control over the data storage, access policy, etc.[/P]<br />
[P]You will have to analyze all these options to pick the one that will fit your budget and provide the desired service level. Sometimes the final decision is also affected by regulatory rules of the specific county. For example, some countries prohibit businesses from storing customers&#39; information on remote servers abroad. In such a case, you will have to go with the on-prem solution.[/P][U]Step #2: UX and localization[/U]<br />
[P]Though ERP is a powerful software solution and the common perception is that it should be complex, this is not how things should work. The tool may not have a fancy interface, but it should be easy-to-use and intuitive, or else the employees will struggle to work with it. And when people struggle, they do not want to use the tool, and the overall effectiveness decreases.[/P]<br />
[P]Another critical factor here is localization, which should go far beyond the translations of buttons and UX elements. International vendors often overlook local regulations and business processes&#39; peculiarities, making the solution completely unusable for local businesses.[/P]<br />
[P]For example, in some Latin American countries, businesses are required to store all operations history. To send this data to regulators, the ERP should be integrated with the State Tax Service &#40;facturacion electronica&#41;. Lots of well-known ERP solutions do not have this integration, while 1Ci:Drive does.[/P][B][U]Step#3: customization and scalability[/U][/B]<br />
[P]As said above, every business is unique, so there will be no ERP to fill all businesses&#39; needs out of the box. And so, you will eventually want to have some customizations. Whether your ERP will deliver them or not is a fundamental question, and it is better to answer it before the implementation starts.[/P]<br />
[P]If the ERP can be flexibly customized in many ways, this will unlock various opportunities for business processes automation and ROI growth. As an example, 1C:Drive ERP enables customers to:[/P][LIST]<br />
[*][P]add CAD/PDM connectors fast, [/P]<br />
[*][P]set up custom dashboards and reports, [/P]<br />
[*][P]conduct multi-currency accounting,[/P]<br />
[*][P]support several processes within one solution &#40;e.g., sales and services&#41;,[/P]<br />
[*][P]manage stocks in real-time.[/P]<br />
[/LIST][P]Another crucial factor is scalability. ERP that can perfectly serve 20 may become a limiting factor when this number grows to 100. So, before you even start to implement your ERP, it is excellent to understand how it can be scaled in the future. Sometimes, vendors implement multiple service tiers based on the user count, or you will be required to purchase additional resources. Sometimes, they offer the same stable solution to everyone, but the tool can&#39;t work great for a tiny startup and a medium-sized production company.[/P]<br />
[P]You will need to spend some time talking to developers, digging into documentation, and searching for the current users&#39; feedback. But the result of this work will pay out when you will experience seamless growth.[/P][B][U]Step #4: data security and support[/U][/B]<br />
[P]Indeed, the system&#39;s security that has access to the most crucial business data is something you should not underestimate. Collect information about encryption, security mechanisms, data management policies, etc.[/P]<br />
[P]You also should have an opportunity to set flexible access permissions, implement additional security measures like two-factor authentication, etc. And when talking cloud, this should be viewed as an extra security risk.[/P]<br />
[P]Also, ERP vendors often do not provide accessible support and training, which may also pose additional risks, reduce efficiency, extend the learning curve, and affect the implementation project timeline.[/P]<br />
[P]There are multiple features and business processes to automate. It is great to have an opportunity to access thorough documentation, talk to the vendor&#39;s local reps, and ask questions on how to unlock the software&#39;s full power.[/P]<br />

[P][B][U]How to set up a requirements list[/U][/B][/P]<br />
[P]An excellent approach to follow when outlining the list of requirements is mapping them to current business processes. For example, this list can look as follows:[/P][LIST]<br />
[*][P]Sales management and Order tracking[/P]<br />
[*][P]Service quality control[/P]<br />
[*][P]Field pre-repair diagnostics, field employees management, and workload control[/P]<br />
[*][P]Warehouse management and procurement planning[/P]<br />
[*][P]Project costing and ROI calculation[/P]<br />
[*][P]Support for complex business processes [/P]<br />
[*][P]Invoicing and cash flow management[/P]<br />
[*][P]Customer relations management[/P]<br />
[/LIST]<br />
[P]After the business processes-based list of requirements is ready, it is time to evaluate the specific ERP product. Here is what you should be looking for.[/P][B][U]Order and pricing management[/U][/B]<br />
[P]Service companies can deal with multiple order types depending on the specific service and the industry. The list may include installation requests, freight requests, orders, etc. The ERP system should be capable of completing a particular task, from creating an order to receiving money from a client.[/P]<br />
[P]Also, many service companies worldwide use custom pricing, offering discounts for specific customers or works. If the volume of such orders is high, it is hard to track all the data. ERP as an automation system should accumulate all pricing data for post- and pre-payment options and automatically apply discount and custom terms following the specific business logic.[/P][U]Service Management<br />
[/U]<br />
One of the primary goals of an ERP implementation is to get a 360-degree view of the whole business. This means the software should provide real-time data on services and employees&#39; performance, key metrics for sales, and productivity for the service company.[P]Service management includes thorough information by service to understand which of them generate good ROI, and where there is room for improvement. The ERP should provide flexible service management to change service parameters or roll-out new ones fast.[/P]<br />
[P]Also, for the service business, many tasks are solved at the customers&#39; side by field staff. So, the ERP should support field operations, or it will be practically useless. The management team should be able to track employee load and performance right away.[/P][B][U]ROI calculation and inventory control[/U][/B]<br />
[P]Services and repair may be hard to evaluate from the ROI standpoint. And this is what a good ERP system should provide to the business. The company should understand the cost of the repair or particular service in this specific case. [/P]<br />
[P]To do so, the ERP system has to track the availability of the necessary spare parts, the delivery time based on the information from suppliers, etc. Moreover, the client can postpone the service like a repair or refuse to order all. If the employee had spent his or her working hours for the assessment, this also needs to be taken into account for cost calculation.[/P][B][U]Customization opportunities[/U][/B]<br />
[P]Service businesses often use custom business processes. Therefore, there are no ERP solutions that can solve all tasks out of the box. Some customization will be required for maximum efficiency. And the software should support such customization. However, in reality, many ERP products do not provide a high level of flexibility, forcing companies to fit their existing business processes into the current software implementation, not adapt the solution to the business needs.[/P]<br />
[P]This approach is rarely successful. When choosing an ERP for a service business, it is crucial to evaluate its flexibility and customization options. For example, the software should provide an opportunity to change its UX, add new modules, and integrate it with the existing business software.[/P][B][U]Easy-to-use interface[/U][/B]<br />
[P]While it is a common perception of an ERP system as something &#39;complex&#39; that should be hard to use, the lighter and easier the UX is, the better results the software delivers. Overly complicated interfaces make workflows harder, generate more data entry mistakes, and demotivate employees working with a system. [/P]<br />
[P]So, maximum efficiency must choose an ERP that is lightweight, easy to adopt, and use. The shorter the onboarding period for each user is, the faster they will reach the highest productivity level.[/P][B][U]Support[/U][/B]<br />
[P]Quite often, business automation solutions vendors do not offer first-line support and training. This can significantly reduce the overall efficiency, extend the learning curve, and affect the implementation project timeline.[/P]<br />
[P]In turn, if the vendor provides all the needed document forms for different scenarios from the service company lifecycle, it will make the adoption of the solution a lot easier. There are multiple features and business processes to automate, and it is great to get an opportunity to ask questions on how to do it faster and in a more efficient way.[/P][B][U]Localization[/U][/B]<br />
[P]International software vendors often lack the proper support of local regulations. For example, in some Latin American countries, businesses are required to store all operations history. To send this data to regulators, the ERP should be integrated with the State Tax Service &#40;facturacion electronica&#41;.

[/P]<br />
[P]Today we will talk about the advantages and disadvantages of ERP, different types of solutions available on the market, and share practical advice on how to choose the software that will benefit your business.[/P]<br />
[P][B][U]Why is ERP Important?[/U][/B][/P]<br />
[P]ERP can become a crucial element of the business infrastructure due to its nature. Such systems are used to centralize the corporate information flows, provide management with the basis for the data-driven and thus more efficient decision-making, reduce costs, and increase revenues.[/P]<br />
[P]As can be seen, the list of potential improvements is extensive, which means that ERP deals with almost every aspect of the company&#39;s everyday life. Here are business processes that are affected by every ERP implementation project:[/P][LIST]<br />
[*][P]Sales Management[/P]<br />
[*][P]Purchase Management [/P]<br />
[*][P]Customer Relationship Management &#40;CRM&#41;[/P]<br />
[*][P]Production Management and Control[/P]<br />
[*][P]Inventory and Warehouse Management[/P]<br />
[*][P]Accounting[/P]<br />
[*][P]Human Resources[/P]<br />
[*][P]Analytics and Reporting[/P]<br />
[/LIST][P]What types of ERP systems are available and most popular on the market?[/P]<br />
[P][B][U]Cloud ERP vs. on-premise ERP[/U][/B][/P]<br />
[P]Nowadays, there are two major types of ERP solutions companies worldwide can choose from on-premise software and cloud systems.[/P]<br />
[P]On-premise or on-prem software works locally within the corporate infrastructure. Thus, the company has full control over its data, implementation process, upgrades, and system development. This requires time and resources; however, it also gives a higher level of flexibility.[/P]<br />
[P]In turn, cloud ERP works in the cloud, meaning the corporate data is stored off-site. Cloud ERP providers have a reliable infrastructure and provide services to multiple customers simultaneously. They have more significant experience in maintaining an ERP; however, the cloud offerings are usually feature-limited and can&#39;t be customized to fit all the unique corporate business processes.[/P]<br />
[P]There are also private clouds, which allow remote data access and a high level of customization to the specific company&#39;s needs. In this case, the company has full control over where the data is stored and who can access this critical business information.[/P]<br />
[P]To choose the type of ERP implementation that will suit the particular company best, you need to evaluate the price of the license and direct and indirect costs, security risks, and regulatory requirements that sometimes restrict companies from storing customers&#39; data on remote servers abroad, etc. [/P]<br />
[P][B][U]Advantages and Benefits of ERP Software Solutions[/U][/B][/P]<br />
[P]There are multiple advantages to having ERP in place. Here are the most notable ones:[/P]<br />
[P][B]Effective production planning[/B][/P]<br />
[P]ERP system allows switching from a spreadsheet-based production planning performed by one person to automated calendar management and task assignments. Thus, productivity bottleneck is removed. Also, an ERP is a perfect solution for cost calculation and predictive analytics of the project&#39;s ROI before it is even sent to production.[/P]<br />
[P][B]Real-time data collection[/B][/P]<br />
[P]One of the popular pain points that force companies to implement an ERP is having lots of business solutions generating disperse data. To effectively use this information, it should be collected in one place and updated in real-time. This is precisely what an ERP system provides to the business, thus allowing more informed and data-backed decisions.[/P]<br />
[P][B]360-Degree View of the company[/B][/P]<br />
[P]Another problem that lots of companies face is getting a 360-degree view of the entire business. Suppose there are multiple departments or legal entities that can even be located abroad. In that case, it is hard to automate the business process for the specific entity or department and get an opportunity to analyze operations at a whole company level. With an ERP, all the meaningful data on sales, planning, customer service, production, distribution, accounting, HR, or multiple legal entities is available immediately. This makes it hard to overlook some vital business trends or events. Also, all branches can perform accounting in local currency, which makes the process easier.[/P]<br />
[P][B]More efficient reporting[/B][/P]<br />
[P]One of the main consequences of the ERP implementation is that the company gets the correct and up to date data on the whole business, which is super-useful for reporting. ERP systems allow creating comprehensive reports to understand the specific department&#39;s performance or even a business-process and generate estimates and predictions based on past data. This is also useful for the most efficient quoting. The company can calculate the projected ROI for every lead and offer discounts and custom terms accordingly to keep the profits positive.[/P]<br />
[P][B]Enhanced collaboration within the company[/B][/P]<br />
[P]When every department has its software and processes, it is hard to collaborate on complex projects that effectively involve multiple departments. Poor communication often leads to a lack of data at every stage of the project or business process execution. As a result, the overall efficiency will be on a low level. The ERP implementation allows all employees to stay on the same page and up to date for better results and faster progress.[/P]<br />
[P][B]Better productivity = higher ROI[/B][/P]<br />
[P]Data is the new oil, thus having lots of data, reports, and estimates to fuel the decision-making process and finding bottlenecks in business processes inevitably leads to higher productivity. And the higher productivity is, the more effective the company is, and the higher the ROI.[/P]<br />
[P][B]Savings on operational costs[/B][/P]<br />
[P]ERP systems eliminate lots of manual labor, saving money immediately, and providing higher data accuracy due to manual information entry. As a result, the business gets more accurate data, and employees can do more critical work saving time on manual labor. [/P]<br />
[P][B]Improved customer service and marketing[/B][/P]<br />
[P]Excellent ERP systems always provide marketing and customer relations features. For example, custom pricing and offerings, or built-in CRM are features that any sound ERP system should offer out of the box. Also, ERPs are accumulating customer data, which allows better personalization.[/P]<br />
[P][B][U]The types of businesses that benefit the most from ERP[/U][/B][/P]<br />
[P]What are businesses that benefit from the ERP implementation? This is a popular question, and here is the list of industries where companies experience the most significant positive outcome from using such software:[/P][LIST]<br />
[*][P]Manufacturing[/P]<br />
[*][P]Wholesale &amp; Distribution[/P]<br />
[*][P]Industrial Services[/P]<br />
[*][P]Service Companies[/P]<br />
[*][P]Professional Services[/P]<br />
[*][P]Construction[/P]<br />
[*][P]Healthcare[/P]<br />
[/LIST]<br />
[P]The list is not full. There are lots of companies from other industries that have implemented an ERP and achieved excellent results. For example, on our website, we have a section called [URL=<a class="txttohtmllink" href="https://www.1ci.com/customer-stories/]Customer">https://www.1ci.com/customer-stories/]Customer</a> Stories[/URL], where we publish case studies on our ERP implementations. As can be seen, the list of customers includes manufacturers, production, construction companies, and service businesses and wholesalers.[/P]<br />
[P][B][U] Why You Should Invest in ERP Software[/U][/B][/P]<br />
[P]That said, we can outline the main benefits of investing in ERP software from the business point of view. You will get:[/P]<br />
[P]More efficient business processes. The nature of an ERP technology suggests that your company will become more efficient at every crucial business process like sales, resource planning, or production by using such a system.[/P]<br />
[P]Accurate data for analytics and decision-making. Eliminating manual work and automated data collection from multiple sources will give the management team a more solid basis for the decision-making process. You will have a detailed 360-degree view of the company, key metrics, and KPIs and run historical analysis and forecasting.[/P]<br />
[P]More money due to savings and higher ROI. ERP system will allow the company to save money on ineffective processes and maximize ROI, which will lead to higher earnings.[/P]<br />
[P]Happy customers and partners. Having an ERP system that helps manage inventory, production load, and warehouse will help provide better customer and partner service. There will be no situations when the customer purchases the out-of-stock product and has to wait. Orders will be processed in a fast and efficient way.[/P]<br />
[P][B][U]What can go wrong: ERP disadvantages[/U][/B][/P]<br />
[P]As with everything in the world, the ERP implementation project will have two sides. Despite multiple advantages, there will also be some complexities and potential problems that could limit the positive outcome of switching to a new solution. Here are some of them:[/P]<br />
[P][B]ERP implementation is usually costly[/B][/P]<br />
[P]The implementation project will undoubtedly require investments, which could be significant if the company has an extensive infrastructure, size, employee count, and lots of business processes to automate. As a result, lots of SMB companies struggle to choose an ERP that will solve their tasks and not cost an arm and leg.[/P]<br />
[P][B]Post-implementation support and development is hard[/B][/P]<br />
[P]If the company&#39;s primary business is not connected to IT and technology, and there are not that many engineers in the team, it might be hard to support the system, customize, and scale it. The only chance to avoid this is to choose an ERP that is customizable and easy to adjust from the beginning. Most cloud ERPs can&#39;t provide these features.[/P]<br />
[P][B]Integration can be tricky[/B][/P]<br />
[P]If the company has lots of business software used by different departments, it is good to integrate them with ERP to get all the data in one place. This might be tricky, as not all business tools are designed with such integrations in mind, and there are ERPs with limited integration capabilities. [/P]<br />
[P][B]ERP selection criteria[/B][/P]<br />
[P]To avoid problems during the implementation and post-implementation management and the development of an ERP, you&#39;ll have to put much effort into choosing the right solution at stage one.[/P]<br />
[P]Here is a checklist of things to do to get the system that will perfectly suit your business, deliver outstanding results, and help to achieve positive ROI:[/P]<br />
[P][B]Outline requirements first[/B][/P]<br />
[P]You won&#39;t succeed without first setting up a list of requirements your future ERP system should meet. First of all, understand what functionality you will need, what business processes to automate, what data might be required during the implementation.[/P]<br />
[P]The great idea is to form an ERP implementation team combining representatives from the management departments whose employees will use the solution to solve this task. This team will need to assess the implementation time and costs and the time and cost of migration to the new system. An ERP implementation will require to deprecate some current IT systems and tools or replace some with new ones.[/P]<br />
[P][B]Assess the feature list[/B][/P]<br />
[P]ERP is a solution that works at a whole business level. The tool should have sufficient functionality to solve all needed tasks in the company from the specific industry. Very often, ERP vendors tailor their systems to a narrow set of tasks or industry-specific business processes. This will limit the efficiency of the system is used in different conditions.[/P]<br />
[P]For example, in a production company, an ERP that lacks planning, cost calculation, technological processes implementation, and variance control will be practically useless. [/P]<br />
[P]To avoid the situation when the company purchases an ERP that can&#39;t deliver any good result, you will need to develop a list of features that should be implemented in a basic implementation. Also, try to find a system with all the necessary parts available out-of-the-box with no need to pay every time you need a new feature. [/P]<br />
[P][B]Evaluate scalability and flexibility[/B][/P]<br />
[P]Scalability and flexibility are two crucial factors that you should assess before making the final decision.  The first thing to think about is whether the solution will still be right for your company when it grows 2x or even 5x. Will the ERP become too costly? Will it scale in terms of efficiency, or will it become more complex to use? Managing 20 seats and 500 is different, and you need to understand whether the system will still be capable of delivering exemplary results if you grow.[/P]<br />
[P]If the system is not flexible enough, it may be hard to use even at your current company size. And if it is hard to use from the beginning, it will be utterly useless in the future. Friction associated with the implementation will also be very high. As a result, the effectiveness of the solution will be limited. So try to find an easy-to-use and flexible system that supports multiple use cases and platforms.[/P]<br />
[P][B]Don&#39;t overlook customization opportunities[/B][/P]<br />
[P]Every company is unique. So, there is no ERP that will fit all your business processes and peculiarities for 100&#37;. You will always want to change or add something, and there are two possible ways to solve this: live with what you have or customize the solution. The customization case can either be an enterprise feature with the corresponding pricing, or the tool can be customizable by its nature.[/P]<br />
[P]The latter will allow you to invest some resources and get a tool that will be perfectly tailored to your needs fast. As so, you should always assess the customization options at the beginning of your ERP shopping process.[/P]";s:12:"~DETAIL_TEXT";s:14169:"[P]No matter what the company size is, business automation software can deliver fantastic results and help to fight competitors.

[P][B][U]What can go wrong: ERP disadvantages[/U][/B][/P]
[P]As with everything in the world, the ERP implementation project will have two sides. Despite multiple advantages, there will also be some complexities and potential problems that could limit the positive outcome of switching to a new solution. Here are some of them:[/P]
[P][B]ERP implementation is usually costly[/B][/P]
[P]The implementation project will undoubtedly require investments, which could be significant if the company has an extensive infrastructure, size, employee count, and lots of business processes to automate. As a result, lots of SMB companies struggle to choose an ERP that will solve their tasks and not cost an arm and leg.[/P]
[P][B]Post-implementation support and development is hard[/B][/P]
[P]If the company&#39;s primary business is not connected to IT and technology, and there are not that many engineers in the team, it might be hard to support the system, customize, and scale it. The only chance to avoid this is to choose an ERP that is customizable and easy to adjust from the beginning. Most cloud ERPs can&#39;t provide these features.[/P]
[P][B]Integration can be tricky[/B][/P]
[P]If the company has lots of business software used by different departments, it is good to integrate them with ERP to get all the data in one place. This might be tricky, as not all business tools are designed with such integrations in mind, and there are ERPs with limited integration capabilities. [/P]
[P][B]ERP selection criteria[/B][/P]
[P]To avoid problems during the implementation and post-implementation management and the development of an ERP, you&#39;ll have to put much effort into choosing the right solution at stage one.[/P]
[P]Here is a checklist of things to do to get the system that will perfectly suit your business, deliver outstanding results, and help to achieve positive ROI:[/P]
[P][B]Outline requirements first[/B][/P]
[P]You won&#39;t succeed without first setting up a list of requirements your future ERP system should meet. First of all, understand what functionality you will need, what business processes to automate, what data might be required during the implementation.[/P]
[P]The great idea is to form an ERP implementation team combining representatives from the management departments whose employees will use the solution to solve this task. This team will need to assess the implementation time and costs and the time and cost of migration to the new system. An ERP implementation will require to deprecate some current IT systems and tools or replace some with new ones.[/P]
[P][B]Assess the feature list[/B][/P]
[P]ERP is a solution that works at a whole business level. The tool should have sufficient functionality to solve all needed tasks in the company from the specific industry. Very often, ERP vendors tailor their systems to a narrow set of tasks or industry-specific business processes. This will limit the efficiency of the system is used in different conditions.[/P]
[P]For example, in a production company, an ERP that lacks planning, cost calculation, technological processes implementation, and variance control will be practically useless. [/P]
[P]To avoid the situation when the company purchases an ERP that can&#39;t deliver any good result, you will need to develop a list of features that should be implemented in a basic implementation. Also, try to find a system with all the necessary parts available out-of-the-box with no need to pay every time you need a new feature. [/P]
[P][B]Evaluate scalability and flexibility[/B][/P]
[P]Scalability and flexibility are two crucial factors that you should assess before making the final decision.  The first thing to think about is whether the solution will still be right for your company when it grows 2x or even 5x. Will the ERP become too costly? Will it scale in terms of efficiency, or will it become more complex to use? Managing 20 seats and 500 is different, and you need to understand whether the system will still be capable of delivering exemplary results if you grow.[/P]
[P]If the system is not flexible enough, it may be hard to use even at your current company size. And if it is hard to use from the beginning, it will be utterly useless in the future. Friction associated with the implementation will also be very high. As a result, the effectiveness of the solution will be limited. So try to find an easy-to-use and flexible system that supports multiple use cases and platforms.[/P]
[P][B]Don&#39;t overlook customization opportunities[/B][/P]
[P]Every company is unique. So, there is no ERP that will fit all your business processes and peculiarities for 100%. You will always want to change or add something, and there are two possible ways to solve this: live with what you have or customize the solution. The customization case can either be an enterprise feature with the corresponding pricing, or the tool can be customizable by its nature.[/P]
[P]The latter will allow you to invest some resources and get a tool that will be perfectly tailored to your needs fast. As so, you should always assess the customization options at the beginning of your ERP shopping process.[/P]";s:16:"DETAIL_TEXT_TYPE";s:4:"text";s:17:"~DETAIL_TEXT_TYPE";s:4:"text";s:11:"DATE_CREATE";s:17:"05.02.2021, 15:40";s:12:"~DATE_CREATE";s:17:"05.02.2021, 15:40";s:15:"DATE_PUBLISH_X1";s:19:"2021-02-05 15:38:00";s:16:"~DATE_PUBLISH_X1";s:19:"2021-02-05 15:38:00";s:12:"DATE_PUBLISH";s:17:"05.02.2021, 15:38";s:13:"~DATE_PUBLISH";s:17:"05.02.2021, 15:38";s:8:"KEYWORDS";N;s:9:"~KEYWORDS";N;s:14:"PUBLISH_STATUS";s:1:"P";s:15:"~PUBLISH_STATUS";s:1:"P";s:8:"ATRIBUTE";N;s:9:"~ATRIBUTE";N;s:10:"ATTACH_IMG";N;s:11:"~ATTACH_IMG";N;s:16:"ENABLE_TRACKBACK";s:1:"N";s:17:"~ENABLE_TRACKBACK";s:1:"N";s:15:"ENABLE_COMMENTS";s:1:"N";s:16:"~ENABLE_COMMENTS";s:1:"N";s:5:"VIEWS";s:3:"104";s:6:"~VIEWS";s:3:"104";s:12:"NUM_COMMENTS";s:1:"0";s:13:"~NUM_COMMENTS";s:1:"0";s:16:"NUM_COMMENTS_ALL";s:1:"0";s:17:"~NUM_COMMENTS_ALL";s:1:"0";s:4:"CODE";s:66:"five-main-pros-and-cons-of-erp-and-how-to-choose-an-ideal-solution";s:5:"~CODE";s:66:"five-main-pros-and-cons-of-erp-and-how-to-choose-an-ideal-solution";s:5:"MICRO";s:1:"N";s:6:"~MICRO";s:1:"N";s:14:"DATE_PUBLISHED";s:1:"Y";s:9:"urlToBlog";s:22:"/digital-intelligence/";s:9:"urlToPost";s:89:"/digital-intelligence/five-main-pros-and-cons-of-erp-and-how-to-choose-an-ideal-solution/";s:11:"urlToAuthor";s:11:"/user/1148/";s:8:"arImages";a:1:{i:48;a:2:{s:5:"small";s:82:"/bitrix/components/bitrix/blog/show_file.php?fid=48&width=70&height=70&type=square";s:4:"full";s:74:"/bitrix/components/bitrix/blog/show_file.php?fid=48&width=1000&height=1000";}}s:13:"TEXT_FORMATED";s:251:"[P]No matter what the company size is, business automation software can deliver fantastic results and help to fight competitors.

It is a global product that helps thousands of companies worldwide to capture growth opportunities and stay flexible in an ever-changing economic environment. In this article, we will talk about capabilities that are now available to our customers in Turkey.<br />
[/P]<br />
[P][B][U]Payments and invoicing[/U][/B][/P]<br />
[P]The 1C:Drive ERP is based on 1C:Enterprise development platform. This ensures the highest level of flexibility and provides customization opportunities. The solution can be used on multiple platforms, including mobile, and integrated with dozens of popular business automation applications. Our users in Turkey can now benefit from all features of 1C:Drive based on our cutting-edge technology.[/P]<br />
[P]Let&#39;s move to the essential features. Before, payment methods in payment terms were limited by several predefined options, including Cash, Electronic, and Undefined. Now, we have added payment terms templates to the Payment terms &amp; conditions settings of the counterparty and contract cards. This feature will allow you to quickly set payment terms for your partners and customers with no need to define each payment term manually. [/P]<br />
[P]Another great feature is the recurring purchase orders. It is useful for those who order goods or services at regular intervals. You can set a schedule for generating purchase orders when required. Companies that charge customers regularly can now use our recurring invoice settings to set a schedule for sending automatic invoices. [/P]<br />
[P]Also, the new 1C:Drive version provides the Checks and Promissory notes modules, which are entirely suitable for the Turkish finance system and crucial for Turkish companies. These new modules are useful for both working with Checks and Promissory notes, including checks issuance, customer checks registration, and more. [/P]<br />
[P]1C:Drive is useful for self-employed people as well. For example, now you can easily create Given and Received self-employment invoices.[/P]<br />
[P][B][U]Sales, purchases and accounting[/U][/B][/P]<br />
[P]Following our customers&#39; needs, we&#39;ve reworked the sales planning process. Now, you can plan sales by products, sales territories, sales representatives, and other sales dimensions. Also, 1C:Drive allows setting sales goals and targets, hassle-free tracking, and running corresponding reports.[/P]<br />
[P]Managerial accounting is no longer the only option in 1C:Drive. The new version of the product features the Financial accounting module and generates GAAP and IFRS-compliant reports.[/P]<br />
[P]Also, we have added the credit limit control feature. It helps companies to secure their accounts receivables. Now you can set specific limits for customers right in the billing details of a contact card. The system will automatically check available credit when you post a sales order, work order, or sales invoice. [/P]<br />
[P]Another essential feature is demand planning. It allows avoiding situations when the businesses run out of goods during high-demand peaks or have an over-filled warehouse when sales are low. Both these cases lead to direct and indirect losses.[/P]<br />
[P]Demand planning is especially important for complex products which can have multiple parameters &#40;like, tissue, size, height, etc.&#41; The variant management and production planning features of 1C:Drive allows companies to understand what the current situation is, plan their stock provisioning, and control the warehouse.[/P]<br />
[P][B][U]Tax management and reporting[/U][/B][/P]<br />
[P]Taxation is a crucial part of any business, and so we pay a lot of attention to the implementation of compliant tax management. We are happy to announce that the new 1C:Drive supports VAT withholding in compliance with the Turkish tax legislation.[/P]<br />
[P]You can store VAT withholding codes and rates and apply them to business documents such as supplier invoices, purchase orders, goods receipts, sales orders, goods issues, sales invoices, and work orders. There is also a specialized report to help you to track VAT withholding[/P]<br />
[P]We&#39;ve also redesigned several other reports. Now, by default, reports show product quantities in base units of measure &#40;UOM&#41;. You can also view product quantities and choose UOM you need.[/P]<br />
[P][B][U]Other improvements[/U][/B][/P]<br />
[P]These are not the only improvements we&#39;ve made. Here are some other upgrades:[/P][LIST]<br />
[*][P]Manufacturer attribute in the Products catalog. Now you can make your labels and price tag templates to show a product&#39;s manufacturer.[/P]<br />
[*][P]Variant selection matrix. Quickly add multiple product variants to business documents &#40;such as sales invoices and supplier invoices&#41;. [/P]<br />
[*][P]Contact information visibility settings. Hide unused contact person fields that overload a counterparty&#39;s card for more straightforward navigation. [/P]<br />
