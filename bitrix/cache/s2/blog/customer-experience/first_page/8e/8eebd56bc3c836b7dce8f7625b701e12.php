[P][B][U]The first question is, why did you decide to implement an ERP? What your main challenges were?[/U][/B]<br />
[/P]<br />
[P]We wanted to reach higher efficiency in medical equipment inventory management and implement a tracking system for medical equipment. The company&#39;s head office in Turkey and our branch in Germany had multiple business automation solutions, including CRM, that were not interconnected and integrated. Lots of data were just stored in Excel spreadsheets. [/P]<br />
[P][B][U]What problems did you face due to that fact?[/U][/B][/P]<br />
[P]This was not sustainable, and we faced lots of errors due to manual data management. It was hard to view the whole business, not just analyze the specific branch. When you do not have a specialized tool, it is hard to implement multi-company and multi-currency management. [/P]<br />
[P]Also, we hoped that the medical ERP system would allow us to manage complex orders, optimize deliveries, and reduce costs due to more efficient warehouse inventory management as we would be able to match requests to the warehouse stock balances on the go.[/P]<br />
[P][B][U]How can you track medical equipment now, as you&#39;ve implemented 1C:Enterprise technology and 1C:Drive?[/U][/B][/P]<br />
[P]We were choosing among four different ERP systems provided by international vendors. 1Ci products became the most flexible, multi-company, and multi currency-friendly. Now we have all the needed information to get reports at a branch or the whole company level. [/P]<br />
[P]The system aggregates and stores data on warehouse stock balances, our procurement plans, match information about orders. So, we never run out of the equipment when we need them and always know what to order in advance.[/P]<br />
[P][B][U]What other tasks were you able to solve using the medical equipment tracking software?[/U][/B][/P]<br />
[P]We&#39;ve got a 360-degree view of the business, can now generate multiple reports and keep track of every business process. The effectiveness of order management and goods dispatching has reached the maximum level. A better, controlled warehouse allows us to reduce costs. Sure, having information about two legal entities in Turkey and Germany in one place is very convenient for the management.[/P]<br />
[P][B][U]Why did you choose 1Ci products among competing solutions?[/U][/B][/P]<br />
[P]1С:Enterprise and 1C:Drive was used due to the flexibility and customization opportunities vital for the medical ERP system. [/P]<br />
[P]These solutions are also perfectly tailored to Turkish not-so-simple legislation, which is crucial for us as a business. Many global vendors lack such support, which makes using their products very hard, and it makes no sense assuming the cost of their solutions. [/P]<br />
[P]But local Turkish solutions were not a good fit either, as we have customers worldwide and Germany&#39;s legal entity. So, we needed to support both multi-currency operations and track everything at both entities and get reports on a whole company level. Only global vendors could offer this functionality. We&#39;ve conducted thorough research and ended up going with the 1Ci products.[/P]<br />
[P][B][U]What did the implementation project look like? Was it long and complicated?[/U][/B][/P]<br />
[P]Actually, no, everything was pretty straightforward and took not that long. The whole process was divided into several steps. First, DND, the 1Ci partner in Turkey, analyzed our business processes, and developed a plan on how the software should be customized and what features to add. Then they implemented these changes. [/P]<br />
[P]Then, our German legal entity has entirely switched to the new software. We&#39;ve tested everything for some time, and after that, our parent company in Turkey has switched all operations except finance and accounting as well. [/P]<br />
[P][B][U]What are your plans for future development and using the ERP and other automation tools?[/U][/B][/P]<br />
[P]After the successful test period, we plan to move our parent company&#39;s finance and accounting to the new ERP for the medical industry.[/P]<br />

[P]So, if your business is about that, the pandemic can open new opportunities and even ease up the expansion. 1Ci partner, First Bit has been developing its Middle East presence for about seven years now, and even pandemic could not limit the business growth. [/P]<br />
[P]This article will present some practical advice by Aleksandr Smolianinov, the head of First Bit Middle East. [/P][B][U]Why UAE[/U][/B]<br />
[P]UAE is a fast-growing region. The country has more than 30 economic free zones and is in the top 10 list for per capita income. Also, 85-90&#37; of the population there are expats, making it easier to do business as an international company. [/P]<br />
[P]Dubai is one of the world&#39;s largest trading and financial centers and is the 3rd largest re-export node, just behind Hong-Kong and Singapore. The country is famous for its oil reserves but has multiple actively developing industries, including production, technology, logistics, and medicine. Many of these industries allowed working in free zones.[/P]<br />
[P]All these factors make UAE an excellent destination for starting an international business.[/P][B][U]Launching a business[/U][/B]<br />
[P]To start operations in the UAE, you will need to form a legal entity. To make it up and running, you&#39;ll need to go through several steps:[/P]<br />
[P]Find a local director; it is mandatory to have a local citizen on board to open a business.[/P][LIST]<br />
[*][P]Get a trade license – if you sell goods or services, you will need a license.[/P]<br />
[*][P]Rent an office – your company needs an official address for communications and where your core team will be located.[/P]<br />
[*][P]Open a bank account[/P]<br />
[*][P]Register your legal entity in the Ministry of Human Resources &amp; Emiratisation &#40;MOHRE&#41; and Ministry of Labor.[/P]<br />
[/LIST][B][U]Next steps: first sales, business processes, team management[/U][/B]<br />
[P]The number one task for any new company on the market is to start generating traction. Thus, you will need sales. Several life hacks help to shrink the time from your sales process to first closed contracts:[/P][LIST]<br />
[*][P]For local businesses going global, find b2b customers with roots in your home country.[/P]<br />
[*][P]Connect with your mother tongue speakers working for your potential customers.[/P]<br />
[*][P]For fully local companies provide discounts to get them the best price possible.[/P]<br />
[/LIST]<br />
[P]These steps will allow you to get on your potential customers&#39; radar and close your first deals. However, to build a sustainable sales process, you will need to enhance your marketing. Launching an international version of a website is a must-have, but it is not sufficient. The best way is to adopt growth hacking, Jobs To Be Done &#40;JBTD&#41; approach for determining customers&#39; needs. Aggressive marketing is the key to success when entering a new market.[/P]<br />
[P]After you&#39;ve come up with some hypotheses on such needs and pain points, it is good to conduct customer development. This approach suggests talking with your potential customers, prospects, and current clients to validate their pain points and offer the best solution for these problems.[/P]<br />
[P]Afterward, you will need to make changes to your product or service to better address these pains and tasks. A thorough sales process should also be implemented, including a CRM system for the proper automation and more effective work on the funnel.[/P]<br />
[P]You will need to have enough people to support all essential business processes in the new market. So, plan to hire a similar number of growth hackers, sales managers, customer care agents. You will usually need more engineers who will adjust and tailor the product to the local needs and implementation experts, who will deploy the product at the customers&#39; side.[/P]<br />
[P]Another crucial thing is to upgrade your implementation process. At every meeting, you should be well-prepared with questions for the customer, homework to be done by the client, and all the necessary data should present in the ERP system.[/P]<br />
[P]You can bring the core team members from your home market, but you can&#39;t make significant progress without using the local talent pool and remote employees.[/P]<br />
[P]Once you&#39;ve assembled the team, launched sales, and started working towards more efficient business processes, it is time to re-evaluate your vision for the future. You will need a plan for business development. When will you be in 1-2-5 years based on your current traction and growth hypotheses? How many customers and what revenue will you have? Such a plan will help you to adjust your business activities and refine your marketing strategy.[/P]<br />
[P][/P]<br />
[P][U]Final thoughts: 4 practical tips[/U]<br />
[/P]<br />
[P]Let&#39;s sum it up by outlining four core tips that will help you settle in the new country, save money on building business processes, and reduce time to the first sale.[/P][LIST]<br />
[*][P]People buy better if the sales manager is local.[/P]<br />
[*][P]You don&#39;t have to move your dev team to a new country. Adjustments can be made from your home region.[/P]<br />
[*][P]Sell subscriptions, not licenses. This will give you a recurring revenue flow and make the business sustainable.[/P]<br />
[*][P]Only accept partnerships that will benefit both parties.[/P]<br />

[P]These steps will allow you to get on your potential customers&#39; radar and close your first deals. However, to build a sustainable sales process, you will need to enhance your marketing. Launching an international version of a website is a must-have, but it is not sufficient.

Such a plan will help you to adjust your business activities and refine your marketing strategy.[/P]
