The country is famous for its oil reserves but has multiple actively developing industries, including production, technology, logistics, and medicine. Many of these industries allowed working in free zones.[/P]
[P]All these factors make UAE an excellent destination for starting an international business.[/P][B][U]Launching a business[/U][/B]
[P]To start operations in the UAE, you will need to form a legal entity. To make it up and running, you&amp;#39;ll need to go through several steps:[/P]

[*][P]Get a trade license – if you sell goods or services, you will need a license.[/P]

[P]These steps will allow you to get on your potential customers&amp;#39; radar and close your first deals. However, to build a sustainable sales process, you will need to enhance your marketing.

The best way is to adopt growth hacking, Jobs To Be Done (JBTD) approach for determining customers&amp;#39; needs. Aggressive marketing is the key to success when entering a new market.[/P]
[P]After you&amp;#39;ve come up with some hypotheses on such needs and pain points, it is good to conduct customer development. This approach suggests talking with your potential customers, prospects, and current clients to validate their pain points and offer the best solution for these problems.[/P]
[P]Afterward, you will need to make changes to your product or service to better address these pains and tasks. A thorough sales process should also be implemented, including a CRM system for the proper automation and more effective work on the funnel.[/P]
[P]You will need to have enough people to support all essential business processes in the new market. So, plan to hire a similar number of growth hackers, sales managers, customer care agents. You will usually need more engineers who will adjust and tailor the product to the local needs and implementation experts, who will deploy the product at the customers&amp;#39; side.[/P]
[P]Another crucial thing is to upgrade your implementation process. At every meeting, you should be well-prepared with questions for the customer, homework to be done by the client, and all the necessary data should present in the ERP system.[/P]
[P]You can bring the core team members from your home market, but you can&amp;#39;t make significant progress without using the local talent pool and remote employees.[/P]
[P]Once you&amp;#39;ve assembled the team, launched sales, and started working towards more efficient business processes, it is time to re-evaluate your vision for the future. You will need a plan for business development. When will you be in 1-2-5 years based on your current traction and growth hypotheses? How many customers and what revenue will you have?
