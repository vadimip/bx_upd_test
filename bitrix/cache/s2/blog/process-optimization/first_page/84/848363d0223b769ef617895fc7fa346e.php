 <br />
[CUT]<br />
 <br />
However, manufacturers often face various difficulties in the planning process. This is especially typical when scaling up production facilities. When a company outgrows the startup phase and is transforming to a medium-sized business, it’s getting evident that previous management and planning approaches don&#39;t work well anymore. <br />
<br />
So let’s have a look at some of the challenges manufacturers might face when it comes to the changes in production planning and how to deal with them.  <br />
<br />
[B][U]A single-manager approach to planning[/U][/B]<br />
<br />
In small production companies, the production plan is usually managed by a single employee. This incurs additional business risks since the company’s production process to a significant extent depends on that one person. Besides, if a production planning manager is the only employee who is well familiar with the production plan or even has access to it, the company may face serious problems in case of his or her sick leave or quitting the job. <br />
<br />
Implementing an ERP system with the production planning features and flexible access rights management can help integrate data flows and make sure your planning activities are transparent and easily accessible to all the parties concerned. You no longer depend on a single employee’s personal records or database since all the data is available in the system.<br />
<br />
[B][U]Manual planning[/U][/B]<br />
<br />
While the company is small, it may be efficient to rely on manual planning and using tools like Excel. But as the business grows, the number of production orders increases and manual planning becomes ineffective. The number of mistakes caused by manual labor skyrockets, additional costs arise. <br />
<br />
For example, if an order is modified or canceled, you’ll need to quickly adjust the production plan – which becomes quite a challenge when handled manually since you have to change data simultaneously in numerous Excel sheets. This makes errors almost inevitable. Another example is the hardship of balancing the number of orders and the production volumes so that there’s no product surplus on the one hand or shortage on the other. When trying to calculate this manually, there’s always a danger of overlooking some crucial factors or numbers. <br />
<br />
To deal with this problem, manufacturers can consider automating the planning process, at least partly, by implementing automation scripts and software integrations. Alternatively, they can consider adopting an all-in-one resources management tool. A unified management and accounting system can help enhance the planning process and eliminate mistakes by tapping into the real-time data on orders, stock, sales, and finances.<br />
<br />
[B][U]Estimating production lead time[/U][/B]<br />
<br />
Another hardship caused by the lack of automation is that it does not allow manufacturers to effectively plan the production lifecycle at the moment when the order is received. The estimation process includes too many variables, so, when calculated manually, the actual shipment may take longer than the customer expects. <br />
<br />
Besides, for bigger companies, different departments can have a hard time syncing the overall schedules and deadlines. Often, they end up producing something that is no longer needed since the deadline wasn’t met and the client has already left. All this predictably results in financial losses and customer churn. <br />
<br />
So, efficient coordination and intelligent resource management are crucial when it comes to planning the production lead time. <br />

 <br />
[CUT]<br />
 <br />
Let’s consider predominant challenges for textile production companies and identify potential solutions to adapt to the rapid changes in the business environment.<br />
<br />
[B][U]Inefficient production planning and warehouse management[/U][/B]<br />
<br />
Very often, production companies can&#39;t build efficient planning due to a lack of automation. Manual planning in Excel is hard and incurs mistakes due to a high workload. Also, this traditional approach does not allow companies to efficiently manage their stock.<br />
<br />
[URL=<a class="txttohtmllink" href="https://www.1ci.com/applications/1c-drive/?utm_source=1ci_blog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=5_challenges_textile&utm_term=article&utm_content=14_09_2021]1C:Drive[/URL">https://www.1ci.com/applications/1c-drive/?utm_source=1ci_blog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=5_challenges_textile&utm_term=article&utm_content=14_09_2021]1C:Drive[/URL</a>] allows textile production companies to analyze their workloads and subcontractor units to plan effectively. Also, the Warehouse management solution allows businesses ​to check out their warehouses with barcodes, including their warehouses in different locations, and see the instant stock status of their products on their shelves.<br />
<br />
[B][U]Absence of consistent monitoring at the factories<br />
[/U][/B]<br />
Managers usually forecast production output by relying on previous experience and performance. Lack of production data and analytics often leads to incorrect assumptions about textile output. This, in turn, results in either surplus stock or underproduction. Both come at a certain price and force managers to make rash decisions.<br />
<br />
That’s why control and analysis of employees’ work are crucial in textile factories. [URL=<a class="txttohtmllink" href="https://www.1ci.com/solutions/textile/?utm_source=1ci_blog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=5_challenges_textile&utm_term=article&utm_content=14_09_2021]The">https://www.1ci.com/solutions/textile/?utm_source=1ci_blog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=5_challenges_textile&utm_term=article&utm_content=14_09_2021]The</a> proper software solution[/URL] allows monitoring work performance to oversee employees’ workload and supply them with raw materials on time.<br />
<br />
Also, in order to have their products checked in different locations, the companies tried to have their personnel connect to the company servers with remote RDP programs and make data entries to their programs from there. Thanks to the 1C:Mobile application, they can now enter data into their programs very quickly with one touch, either on a phone or tablet.<br />
<br />
[B][U]Time-consuming manual reports[/U][/B]<br />
<br />
Along with the lack of monitoring, manual reports are troublesome as well. Reports lost in thousands of emails or delivered hard copies create chaos and complicate the overall process. Parties in the supply chain may even face the so-called «bullwhip effect»: distorted information on supply and demand, which often stems from poor communication. It can lead to immense losses, from excessive inventory investment, ineffective transportation to poor customer service.<br />
<br />
[URL=<a class="txttohtmllink" href="https://www.1ci.com/solutions/textile/?utm_source=1ci_blog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=5_challenges_textile&utm_term=article&utm_content=14_09_2021]1Ci">https://www.1ci.com/solutions/textile/?utm_source=1ci_blog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=5_challenges_textile&utm_term=article&utm_content=14_09_2021]1Ci</a> ERP solution for the textile industry[/URL] addresses and eliminates all the mentioned issues. With the software, you’ll be able to oversee the performance and get reports not only from the main factory but also from the remaining places and subcontractors: distributed factories, departments, warehouses and shops.<br />
<br />
Also, textile companies often sell their goods through e-commerce websites. Analyzing reports from these marketplaces is usually a very hard and time-consuming task. When done manually, lots of mistakes arise, and it is hard to track the sales performance and control ROI. Thanks to the 1C:Drive E-commerce website integrations, textile companies can perform instant stock and sales management for third-party platforms.<br />
<br />
[B][U]Employees feel replaceable and unaccountable<br />
[/U][/B]<br />
The number of employees in the factory can reach several hundred. Most of them are usually working hard and concentrating on a certain task. Whether they’re sewing or inspecting ready-made clothing, they often keep minimum interaction and don’t give feedback. This, in turn, makes employees unmotivated and weakens efficiency. <br />
<br />
To avoid inefficiencies, you can [URL=<a class="txttohtmllink" href="https://www.1ci.com/solutions/textile/?utm_source=1ci_blog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=5_challenges_textile&utm_term=article&utm_content=14_09_2021]unify">https://www.1ci.com/solutions/textile/?utm_source=1ci_blog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=5_challenges_textile&utm_term=article&utm_content=14_09_2021]unify</a> all manufacturing stages within a single information system[/URL]: sewing, washing, ironing, quality control and others. Overseeing performance in numbers and getting reports and feedback will raise the level of responsibility among employees. Setting KPIs for every section will have the same effect. Besides, you can create an award system and stimulate them to get “The best employee of the month” title and fair compensation.<br />
<br />
[B][U]Production defects<br />

Let’s consider predominant challenges for textile production companies and identify potential solutions to adapt to the rapid changes in the business environment.

[B][U]Inefficient production planning and warehouse management[/U][/B]

Very often, production companies can&#39;t build efficient planning due to a lack of automation. Manual planning in Excel is hard and incurs mistakes due to a high workload. Also, this traditional approach does not allow companies to efficiently manage their stock.

[URL=https://www.1ci.com/applications/1c-drive/?utm_source=1ci_blog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=5_challenges_textile&utm_term=article&utm_content=14_09_2021]1C:Drive[/URL] allows textile production companies to analyze their workloads and subcontractor units to plan effectively. Also, the Warehouse management solution allows businesses ​to check out their warehouses with barcodes, including their warehouses in different locations, and see the instant stock status of their products on their shelves.

[B][U]Absence of consistent monitoring at the factories
[/U][/B]
Managers usually forecast production output by relying on previous experience and performance. Lack of production data and analytics often leads to incorrect assumptions about textile output. This, in turn, results in either surplus stock or underproduction. Both come at a certain price and force managers to make rash decisions.

That’s why control and analysis of employees’ work are crucial in textile factories. [URL=https://www.1ci.com/solutions/textile/?utm_source=1ci_blog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=5_challenges_textile&utm_term=article&utm_content=14_09_2021]The proper software solution[/URL] allows monitoring work performance to oversee employees’ workload and supply them with raw materials on time.

Also, in order to have their products checked in different locations, the companies tried to have their personnel connect to the company servers with remote RDP programs and make data entries to their programs from there. Thanks to the 1C:Mobile application, they can now enter data into their programs very quickly with one touch, either on a phone or tablet.

[B][U]Time-consuming manual reports[/U][/B]

Along with the lack of monitoring, manual reports are troublesome as well. Reports lost in thousands of emails or delivered hard copies create chaos and complicate the overall process. Parties in the supply chain may even face the so-called «bullwhip effect»: distorted information on supply and demand, which often stems from poor communication. It can lead to immense losses, from excessive inventory investment, ineffective transportation to poor customer service.

With the software, you’ll be able to oversee the performance and get reports not only from the main factory but also from the remaining places and subcontractors: distributed factories, departments, warehouses and shops.

Also, textile companies often sell their goods through e-commerce websites. Analyzing reports from these marketplaces is usually a very hard and time-consuming task. When done manually, lots of mistakes arise, and it is hard to track the sales performance and control ROI. Thanks to the 1C:Drive E-commerce website integrations, textile companies can perform instant stock and sales management for third-party platforms.

[B][U]Employees feel replaceable and unaccountable
[/U][/B]
The number of employees in the factory can reach several hundred. Most of them are usually working hard and concentrating on a certain task. Whether they’re sewing or inspecting ready-made clothing, they often keep minimum interaction and don’t give feedback. This, in turn, makes employees unmotivated and weakens efficiency. 

To avoid inefficiencies, you can [URL=https://www.1ci.com/solutions/textile/?utm_source=1ci_blog&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=5_challenges_textile&utm_term=article&utm_content=14_09_2021]unify all manufacturing stages within a single information system[/URL]: sewing, washing, ironing, quality control and others. Overseeing performance in numbers and getting reports and feedback will raise the level of responsibility among employees. Setting KPIs for every section will have the same effect. Besides, you can create an award system and stimulate them to get “The best employee of the month” title and fair compensation.

[B][U]Production defects
[/U][/B]
No wonder that unsatisfied employees, obsolete reporting and inconsistent data increase the rate of production defects. The inability to meet excessive demand, for example, will require a significant performance boost, which will definitely result in a higher number of garment flaws. 

The outcome can be devastating: it affects not only the profit but also the reputation of a brand.

 <br />
The COVID-19 outbreak again emphasized the risks associated with the consumption of contaminated products, especially meat. This, in turn, led to even more customers’ concerns and shifts in demand.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, these are not the only challenges food production companies may face. Let’s discuss the most threatening ones and consider feasible solutions.<br />
<br />
[B][U]Compliance and regulations issues[/U][/B]<br />
<br />
Due to COVID-19 consequences, there has been unprecedented pressure on food processors. The intensified measures involve greater sanitization, cleaning, increased control and transparency within the supply chain cycle to avoid contamination. Therefore, food producers have to stay informed about coming regulations and make sure their current operations comply with the guidelines.<br />
<br />
The emergence of robust ERP systems allowed businesses in the food industry to ensure the quality of the products. For instance, [URL=<a class="txttohtmllink" href="https://www.1ci.com/applications/1c-drive/]1Ci">https://www.1ci.com/applications/1c-drive/]1Ci</a> ERP Solutions[/URL] can automate monitoring of raw food processing and packaging as well as management of temperature conditions in storage. Additionally, you’ll be able to collect detailed storage documentation and create specified reports for regulatory bodies.<br />
<br />
[B][U]Supply chain disruptions and market shifts[/U][/B]<br />
<br />
The food production industry is especially sensitive in terms of demand shifts. Insufficient demand can have devastating consequences. Due to the short shelf-life of such products as dairy, meat and fish, oversupplies can lead to significant financial losses, as all products turn into garbage in a matter of days, while the risk of contamination increases at high speed. <br />
<br />
There are several causes of demand instability in 2021. On the one hand, as a result of pandemic restrictions, there are now more people buying food at grocery stores and less – in places of public catering, like restaurants. On the other hand, as people are generally more concerned about a healthy lifestyle and coronavirus threat, their preferences might shift – for example, they tend to eat less meat and fish. <br />
<br />
To meet the demand on time, avoid oversupply and prevent spoilage, food producers may successfully exploit [URL=<a class="txttohtmllink" href="https://www.1ci.com/solutions/food/]ERP">https://www.1ci.com/solutions/food/]ERP</a> systems designed for the food industry[/URL]. A proper ERP system allows businesses to enhance traceability of the date and condition of products and raw materials: whether they’re fresh, frozen, or close to the expiry date.<br />
<br />
[B][U]Poor communication and obsolete operations[/U][/B]<br />
<br />
Supply chain management is meaningless without effective communication. This is directly linked to the presence of up-to-date digital tools in business operations. Lack of collaboration, manual reports and guesswork impede growth and maximization of profitability. Taking into account the short lifespan of certain products, these practices are unacceptable. <br />
<br />
Therefore, companies in the food industry have to aim to provide their business with a fully connected supply chain.<br />

Automated integration of multiple business functions will streamline data processing and minimize manual data entry errors. <br />
<br />
[B][U]Lack and absenteeism of labor[/U][/B]<br />
<br />
It’s important to mention that there has always been a lack of talented labor in the food industry. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 outbreak only exacerbated the issue. The industry is one of the most suffering ones as the number of employees tested positive is incredibly high. <br />
<br />
Besides, the situation generally influences the mental health of the rest, creates additional anxiety and makes them afraid of going to work. Consequently, the declining number of employees pauses necessary operations and jeopardizes business.<br />

With automation of some critical processes in facilities, you can give remote access to the system to some employees, so they’ll be able to work from home. But keep in mind that they’ll need proper training to exploit the software in the right manner.<br />
<br />
[B][U]Bottom line[/U][/B]<br />
<br />
End-to-end transparency in the processes gives full control of production, provides high service, keeps inventory levels as low as possible and helps deliver fresh products at the right time, at the right places.  <br />

[P]Both make-to-order and make-to-stock models have peculiarities connected to order processing and management. For make-to-stock production, companies can pre-define product parameters and characteristics: i.e., different items like furniture can have predefined &quot;color.&quot; 1C:Drive helps such manufacturers optimize this process using the product characteristics generator based on predefined characteristics and their types. Also, make-to-order manufacturers use built-in order progress reports and demand planning tool to plan materials procurement, usage, and the completion time. [/P][U]Production planning[/U]<br />
[P]Make-to-stock manufacturers focus on production before the actual orders are received. In this case, the output level planning mainly relies on forecasting demand as accurately as possible.

[P]Make-to-order businesses only start manufacturing products after they receive a customer order. Production planning can be more complicated than mass production because order can be either standard or unique, requiring specific equipment, materials, and employee resources.  Besides, it is crucial for manufacturers to accurately assess the cost of each product before they get down to production so that deviations from the initial quote are minimal. Very often, the planning actually starts during the negotiations with the customers.[/P]<br />
[P]Automating these processes can be really helpful. For example, with 1C:Drive ERP solution, make-to-order manufacturers enjoy full control of the production planning. They can fulfill more orders simultaneously by keeping track of production resources, prioritizing, scheduling, and monitoring the status of production orders.[/P][U]Warehouse stocks[/U]<br />
[P]As already mentioned above, a make-to-stock strategy focuses on matching the warehouse stocks with anticipated consumer demand. The crucial thing is to forecast future demand and ensure that the inventory in stock is sufficient. If the demand is lower than expected, this leads to overstocking and wasted money, while high demand might result in failing to fulfill it. [/P]<br />
[P]In a make-to-order workflow, the completed items are not stored in the warehouse but manufactured especially for a particular purchase order and shipped to the customer straight away. However, there’s a problem of sufficient materials stocks and human resources, which also requires demand analysis.

[P]This is precisely where ERP can be indispensable. With 1C:Drive, make-to-order businesses can optimize resources, monitor material stocks, and determine bottlenecks.

[P][/P][U]High transaction costs and multiple currencies[/U]<br />
[P][/P]<br />
[P]High transaction fees and navigating your way around different currencies can be confusing for businesses thinking of expanding abroad.[/P]<br />
[P][/P]<br />
[P]International transaction costs include fees and expenses associated with credit cards, payment gateways, legal fees, e-commerce platforms, returns, and exchanges, left alone shipping. While transaction costs are unavoidable, there are some ways to reduce them by carefully choosing the payment processing provider, offering various payment methods apart from credit cards &#40;which imply 2.3-2.5&#37; transaction fees&#41;, and keeping all your accounting accurate to avoid errors. [/P]<br />

The company can have multiple contracts under the specific customer and simultaneously get the total balance for the customer in the local currency, which is super-convenient from the accounting and taxes point of view. For instance, the company can issue invoices in any currency, pay received invoices not in the currency of the invoice and consolidate all balances correctly.[/P]<br />
[P][/P][U]Customs declarations[/U]<br />
[P][/P]<br />
[P]When the company imports some goods, the need for filing a customs declaration occurs. These declarations can differ based on the local legislation, and based on that document, the customs fees and excises are accrued, and import VAT is charged. The declaration is used to register imported goods, their quantity, and value.[/P]<br />

[P][/P][U]Language and cultural barriers[/U]<br />
[P][/P]<br />
[P]Good communication is at the core of an effective international business strategy. However, it is usually more difficult to do business in a foreign country than in one&#39;s home country because of language and culture-specific barriers. Consider hiring an interpreter to help with negotiations and consulting a native speaker to ensure your marketing communications sound good in the target language. [/P]<br />
[P][/P]<br />
[P]But it&#39;s often more than just a language barrier — nonverbal communication can affect business deals as well. Learn how different cultural values and norms can influence the way you communicate in a professional context. Being aware of business etiquette abroad and things like religious and cultural traditions can help you better navigate potential communication problems in overseas business. [/P]<br />

[P]Considering the language aspect from the users’ view, 1C:Drive enables each of them to work in a convenient language in the same system account. Partners normally add new languages during the implementation. [/P]<br />
[P] [/P][U]Shipping and logistics[/U]<br />
[P][/P]<br />
[P]Shipping and logistics management is probably a key factor in cross-border trade, which can become a serious challenge for businesses. Statistics show that high shipping prices are the number one reason for consumers to abandon shopping carts. [/P]<br />
[P][/P]<br />
[P]So it&#39;s crucial to find the right shipping partner with the best rates while still being reliable. A good logistics provider is experienced in dealing with legal regulations and customs and can help guide your business through these challenges.[/P]<br />

[P][/P][U]Global pricing strategy[/U]<br />
[P][/P]<br />
[P]Setting optimal prices for your products or services can be tricky when doing business overseas. You need to ensure your pricing remains competitive while still bringing you profit. Consider researching the prices of direct local competitors to get a benchmark. [/P]<br />
[P][/P]<br />
[P]Still, it is essential to take all your extra costs into account — for instance, the cost of production and shipping, overseas marketing, import/export taxes, and distribution.[/P]<br />

Nowadays, to stay competitive, companies should perfectly know where their products are[CUT], what inventory is left in stock in what location, calculate flexible discounts on the go, manage customer-oriented processes, and collect business-critical data in one system to fuel the decision-making process. [/P]<br />
[P]The perfect solution to these tasks is an ERP system. But there are dozens of vendors out there, and it might be hard to choose the right solution that will fit the specific company&#39;s structure and unique business processes. What to look for when shopping for an ERP? Today we will talk about four key components of such systems to look for.[/P]<br />
[P][B][SIZE=18pt]Intro: benefits of ERP software for wholesale distributors[/SIZE][/B][/P]<br />
[P]ERP, which is an acronym for Enterprise Resource Planning, is a solution that helps companies to better understand what goods they have in stock, what to plan for procurement, efficiently manage all branches and warehouses. [/P]<br />
[P]Basically, ERP helps to avoid situations when the customer wants to purchase something, which is not in stock or having too much inventory to fill the current demand &#40;overstocking&#41; and accumulating business-critical data in one system for better management and accounting. This leads to business processes optimization, cost reduction, and revenue growth.[/P]<br />
[P][B][SIZE=18pt]Features to look for in ERP for distributors and wholesalers[/SIZE][/B][/P]<br />
[P]ERP systems are used by wholesalers and distributors to solve several tasks that may seem simple at first glance. First, they need to manage their warehouse better, reducing costs, and optimizing the procurement and shipping process. Also, they need to automate their sales tasks to achieve better productivity and higher ROI. Finally, they need to collect all business information in one place to make data-driven decisions, run comprehensive reports, and come up with more realistic plans.[/P]<br />
[P]So, what a wholesale and distribution ERP should be capable of delivering the highest value possible? What are the key features of ERP?[/P]<br />
[P][B]Basic functionality[/B][/P]<br />
[P]Wholesalers and distributors play an essential role in the supply chain by filling retailers&#39; orders and providing sales to manufacturers. To succeed in the wholesale business, the company should build perfect business processes related to purchases, sales, order management, and warehouse management. And this is the basis the wholesale distribution ERP should provide.[/P]<br />
[P]The software should automate the whole sales lifecycle from the entry point of the first contact to the transaction and the order fulfillment tracking. As most of the contracts in the distribution business are custom, the solution also should provide features for custom pricing, support working with different types of businesses and business processes &#40;post and prepayments, for example&#41;. More importantly, these features should be available out of the box without purchasing additional modules and add-ons.[/P]<br />
[P]Also, the system must work with complex products and manage all the characteristics and requirements. It is often a situation when one product can have multiple options &#40;size, color, etc.&#41;, and wholesale distribution software should provide ways to work with that without additional overhead.[/P]<br />
[P]Finally, the ERP solution should provide warehouse management functionality or useless for wholesalers and distribution companies.[/P]<br />
[P][B]Sales[/B][/P]<br />
[P]The wholesale and distribution business is built around sales. It is a critical business process that should be automated appropriately for better results. This can be done by pulling in customer data from multiple channels like POS software or field sales mobile applications &#40;one of the features of 1C:Drive&#41;. The ERP software for wholesalers and distributors should have the following features:[/P][LIST]<br />
[*][P]sales order processing[/P]<br />
[*][P]customer pricing[/P]<br />
[*][P]shipping management[/P]<br />
[*][P]returns management[/P]<br />
[*][P]self-service features for customers and vendors[/P]<br />
[*][P]sales reporting[/P]<br />
[/LIST]<br />
[P]ERP system should allow flexible sales management, including flexible discounts, to offer the best price to the customer. [/P]<br />
[P]Another important thing is the inter-trade support for international contracts. ERP should support different currencies, languages, branches and legal entities, and local regulations – for example, Poland, Germany, and Turkey have their unique legislation not all international vendors can support.[/P]<br />
[P][B]Supply chain and supplier management[/B][/P]<br />
[P]Supply chain performance is crucial for the success in the wholesale and distribution business. The ERP system must provide an ability to track inventory transactions, avoid overstocking and understocking, fuel procurement, etc.[/P]<br />
[P]Besides the stock inventory, wholesale distribution software should provide insights on delivery times for different suppliers&#39; specific goods, create procurement orders, and track the delivery. Also, if the supplier fails to meet the agreement&#39;s requirements, the ERP should fire notifications for such incidents.[/P]<br />
[P]Another essential feature is the demand forecasting. It is a popular approach to fight overstocking and understocking using the demand data from previous periods. The ERP solution can advise when it is an excellent time to purchase more product or raw materials, and when you should empty your stocks.[/P]<br />
[P][B]Customer management[/B][/P]<br />
[P]The right ERP for distributors should also fuel customer management processes. This means the solution must support a wide range of features, including:[/P][LIST]<br />
[*][P]campaign and leads management[/P]<br />
[*][P]salesforce automation[/P]<br />
[*][P]customer service and support[/P]<br />
[/LIST]<br />
[P]You should be able to collect all customer-oriented data in one single solution, eliminating the need for double data entry, manual labor-related mistakes, and data inconsistencies and losses during transfers between multiple systems.[/P]<br />
[P][B]Reporting[/B][/P]<br />
[P]To stay competitive, wholesalers and distributors should always be on top of business operations, which means high-quality reporting. ERP solution is often implemented to gather business data from multiple systems in one place and run thorough reports using this information.[/P]<br />
[P]This is crucial for better demand forecasting, procurement and warehouse planning, financial ROI calculation, and lots more. The data should be implemented in real-time, allowing the decision-makers to fuel their actions with the most accurate and relevant data.[/P]<br />
[P]Detailed reports will help the business to identify opportunities for business processes enhancement, find bottlenecks, unlock the growth potential, and, thus, the company will be more competitive.[/P]<br />
[P][B]Integrations, scaling, and customizations[/B][/P]<br />
[P]There is no silver bullet that can solve all business tasks. Every business uses a broad scope of human resources, customer relationships, financial, and project management. Having an opportunity to integrate an ERP with these tools leads to higher synergy and a 360-degree view of all business processes, which is super-useful for decision-makers. [/P]<br />
[P]Suppose the ERP can be easily integrated with other business software. In that case, this reduces the friction that may arise at the very beginning of the implementation process, reduce costs on integrating the new solution to the business&#39; toolkit, and strengthen the overall positive effect.[/P]<br />
[P]Also, the ERP should stimulate, not limit the growth of the business. This means that there should be a way to quickly scale the system by adding new modules when this is needed. Such a flexible modular structure will reduce initial costs on ERP implementation and make it easier to scale in the future. For example, 1C:Drive allows starting with a basic set of features and then adding functions on-the-fly when this is a real business need. [/P]<br />
[P]Moreover, the ability to flexibly adapt the software and even create own add-ons may be crucial for wholesale and distribution businesses dealing with multiple counterparties. If an ERP provides a way of making project-based connections between the solution and external third-party systems, this ensures reliable data exchange without losses.[/P]<br />
[P][B][SIZE=18pt]Final thoughts: how to choose the right ERP for distributors? [/SIZE][/B][/P]<br />

[P][B][U]Intro: make to stock vs make to order[/U][/B][/P]<br />
[P]The most popular workflows could be described by make to stock and make to order. Each approach has its unique characteristics and is used by companies of different sizes and business models. Below, we will describe how they are different and what automation tools best suit each case.[/P]<br />
[P][B][U]Enterprise production: make to stock[/U][/B][/P]<br />
[P]This production workflow is usually used by enterprise companies that manufacture products for inventory. Such companies use historical sales data for building sales forecasts and model customer demand to fill it.[/P]<br />
[P]The critical element here is to match the business production and inventory in stock with the demand. If the demand is too low, this may lead to overstocking and losses if the demand is higher than expected, then the company may fail to match it. This will also lead to problems and losses. The recent example of such a situation is Intel that can&#39;t fill the demand and produce enough chips. This leads to the company&#39;s stock losing value.[/P]<br />
[P]Mistakes in calculations for demand, inventory, and production capacity can lead to similar business problems in any industry. This is why such enterprise companies mainly rely on specialized ERP systems that help them to build more precise forecasts.[/P]<br />
[P][B][U]Job shops: make to order model[/U][/B][/P]<br />
[P]Job shops are typically medium or small manufacturers that make specific products for one customer at a time. This workflow assumes that the production process starts once the order is received. Such companies do not forecast demand and fill the warehouse with products for future shipping. [/P]<br />
[P]Moreover, the production here is highly customizable as orders may differ slightly or substantially. This is also called bespoke products – customers provide their specifications, and the production process is altered according to this input. I.e., the specific goods are manufactured to fill the particular customer&#39;s needs.[/P]<br />
[P]This is evident that such a model requires a unique approach to automation, as planning, production process management, and sales work differ from the make to stock workflow.[/P]<br />

[P]For both workflows, a proper automation solution is a must. For make to stock companies here are the problems the right software can help to solve:[/P]<br />
[P]Manage the risks associated with consumer trends predictability. ERP that allows building a highly accurate forecast based on past sales and seasonal spikes saves real resources.[/P]<br />
[P]Another crucial task is inventory management and procurement. The company always has what it needs to fill the demand and clear the stocks at the right moment.[/P]<br />

[*][P]Modules for product cost calculation.[/P]<br />
[*][P]Efficient planning that allows keeping the production in the positive ROI segment.[/P]<br />
[*][P]Warehouse control features are needed to get real-time data on inventory levels to match them with the forecasted demand.[/P]<br />
[/LIST]<br />
[P]In turn, make to order companies need to:[/P][LIST]<br />
[*][P]plan production cost – it is crucial for job shops to predict the cost of the production of the specific item before the process even started and verify the calculation after the product is ready.[/P]<br />
[*][P]assess how exactly the production times and time to start the production will be affected by the delivery of needed components.[/P]<br />
[*][P]dispatch the production based on the data from the MES system or mobile app for sending tasks to employees.[/P]<br />
[/LIST]<br />
<br />
[P]All these tasks require a different feature set for an ERP and business automation software:[/P][LIST]<br />
[*][P]Real-time order tracking: the company should be able to close orders fast and efficiently to free the production line for the next one.[/P]<br />
[*][P]Cost of goods sold calculation. Again, to keep ROI positive, the company should be able to perform cost calculations on the go to identify orders that do not lead to profit.[/P]<br />
